== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar devstudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.11 (2019-03) but we recommend
using the latest http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers[Eclipse 4.11 2019-03 JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
Eclipse 2019-03 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2019-03 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.

=== OpenShift 3

==== New OpenShift connection helper

When you need to defined a new OpenShift connection, you need to provide the following information:

- cluster URL
- username and password or token

If you've already logged in your cluster through the OpenShift Web Console, you can copy an `oc` command
in the clipboard that contains both the cluster URL and your token. 

So, from now, there is a new option that allows you to initialize the wizard fields from the copied `oc`
command:

Click on the `Paste Login Command` button and the fields will be initialized:

=== Server tools

==== EAP 7.2 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with EAP 7.2.

==== Wildfly 15 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 15. It adds support for Java EE 8.

==== Wildfly 16 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 16. It adds support for Java EE 8. 

=== Hibernate Tools

==== New Runtime Provider

The new Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider has been added. It incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.1.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.1.Final

==== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.9.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.9.Final.

The Hibernate 5.2 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.2.18.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.2.12.Final.


=== Maven

==== Maven support updated to M2E 1.11

The Maven support is based on Eclipse M2E 1.11

=== Platform

==== Views, Dialogs and Toolbar
 
===== User defined resource filters in Project Explorer

The *Filters and Customization...* menu in *Project Explorer* now shows an additional *User filters*
tab which can be used to exclude some resources from Project Explorer based on their name.

Full name and regular expressions are supported.

===== Error Log view added to Platform

The *Error Log* view has been moved from the PDE project to the Platform project. See
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=50517[bug 50517] for details.

===== Copy to clipboard in Installation Details

A copy to clipboard action has been added to all tabs of the *Installation Details* dialog.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/copy-installation-details.png[]

===== Copy & paste of Environment Variables

The *Environment* tab in a *Launch configuration* dialog supports copy & paste actions now. The environment
variables are transferred as text data, so it is not only possible to copy & paste between two different
launch configurations, but also between the launch configuration and e.g. some text editor or the command line. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/env-var-copy-paste.png[]

This feature is available in all launch configurations which use the common *Environment* tab.

===== Useful links to add projects to empty workspace

When Eclipse IDE is started for the first time or with a new workspace, it may not be intuitive for new users
on how to proceed. To help the users in getting started, the following useful links have been provided to add
a project to the workspace:

* Perspective specific project creation wizard
* Generic New Project wizard
* Import projects wizard

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/ProjectExplorer.png[]

===== New mnemonics in Error Log view

New mnemonics have been added for *Export Entry...* and *Event Detail* entries in the context menu of *Error Log* view.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/mneumonics.png[]

==== Themes and Styling 

===== Improved Dark theme for Mac

The Dark theme for Mac has been improved to use the colors from the macOS system dark appearance. Some of the
notable changes in Eclipse IDE are the dark window title bar, menus, file dialogs, combos and buttons.  

Note: This change is available on macOS Mojave and later.

Before:

After:

===== Improved Dark theme for Windows

The drawing operations have been improved in Windows so the custom drawn icons look better now.
For example, check the close icon below.

Before:

==== General Updates

===== Performance improvements

The startup and interactive performance of multiple operations has been improved again in this release.

=== Java Developement Tools (JDT)

==== Java 12 Support

===== Java 12

http://jdk.java.net/12/[Java 12] is out and Eclipse JDT supports Java 12 for 4.11 via
https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/java-12-support-eclipse-2019-03-411[Marketplace]. The release
notably includes the following Java 12 feature:
http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325[JEP 325: Switch Expressions (Preview)]. Please note that this is a
http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12[preview language feature] and hence enable preview option should be on.
For an informal introduction of the support, please refer to
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Java12/Examples[Java 12 Examples wiki].

==== JUnit

===== JUnit 5.4

https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.4.0/release-notes/[JUnit 5.4] is here and Eclipse JDT has been
updated to use this version.

===== Test factory template

JUnit Jupiter now allows test factory methods to return a single ```DynamicNode```. The ```test_factory```
template has been updated to include ```DynamicNode``` in the return type.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/junit-test-template.png[]

==== Java Editor 

===== Default and constant values in content assist information pop-up

The additional information pop-up of a content assist proposal now shows the default value
of an annotation type element:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/default-value-annotation-type-elelemt.png[]

and the value of a constant:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/constant-value.png[]

===== Create service provider method

If a service defined in a ```module-info.java``` file has an invalid service provider implementation,
a *Quick Fix (Ctrl + 1)* is now available to create the new provider method:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/service-provider-proposal.png[]

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/service-provider-linked-proposal.png[]

==== Java Formatter 

===== Line wrapping settings for binary operators

Instead of a single line wrapping setting for binary expressions, there's now a whole section of settings
for various kinds of *binary operators* (multiplicative, additive, logical, etc.). There are settings
for _relational_ (including equality) and _shift_ operators, which were not covered by the old setting.
Also, _string concatenation_ can now be treated differently from arithmetic sum.

The settings can be found in the Profile Editor (*Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Edit...*)
under the *Line Wrapping > Wrapping settings > Binary expressions* subsection.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/formatter-wrap-binary-expressions.png[]

===== White space settings for binary operators

The white space around operators in *binary expressions* can now be controlled separately for different groups
of operators, consistent with the line wrapping settings.

The new *Binary operators* sub-section has been added under White Space > Expressions in the Formatter
profile editor.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/formatter-spaces-binary-expressions.png[]

===== Wrapping setting for chained conditional expressions

A chain of _nested conditional expressions_ (using ternary operator) can be now wrapped as a single group,
with all of them indented at the same level. It's only possible for right-sided nesting.

Find the *Chained conditionals* setting in the Profile Editor under the
*Line Wrapping > Wrapping settings > Other expressions* subsection.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/formatter-wrap-chained-conditionals.png[]

===== Indent Javadoc tag descriptions

The Formatter Profile has a new setting that indents wrapped Javadoc tag descriptions.
It's called _Indent other tag descriptions when wrapped_, in contrast to the preexisting _Indent wrapped
@param/@throws descriptions_ setting. It affects tags like ```@return``` or ```@deprecated```.

The settings can be found in the Profile Editor (*Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Edit...*)
under the *Comments > Javadocs* section.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.11/images/formatter-indent-tags.png[]

==== Debug

===== History for expressions in the Variables view

The *Variables* view now stores a history of the expressions used in the *Detail* pane. You can choose
a _previously entered expression_ for a variable from the new drop-down menu. The expression will be
copied to the *Detail* pane where you can select it to perform various actions present in the context menu.
