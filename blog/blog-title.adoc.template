// if that file is missing create one and submit together with the blog.
:page-author: maxandersen
// page-tags: used to categorize the blog entry. Try not going overboard here.
// use components from jira, try keep them short and not require spaces. 
// Note: jbosscentral is a magic tag that makes it show up on jbosscentral
// Leave that out if your blog entry has a narrow audience scope.

Start with an introduction. Do not give it a title, just a paragraph or two. 

== Use 2-level titles

If you don't know asciidoctor syntax you can see more at http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference.

=== You can even go with deeper titles

If you got code to show do it like this:

```java
 import org.jboss.tools.*;
 
 class JBossTools extends Eclipse {

   protected Team spirit;
   public Issues development;
   private Satisfaction guaranteed;

 }

And you can add screenshots:

Put images inside the `images` folder with a unique name, all lowercase.

=== Menus, keyboard and buttons have their own style

When using menus like menu:Preferences[Guide > The > User], keyboard
shortcuts like kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+P] or even buttons like btn:[Ok] then
there is a style for it.

== End on a positive note

...and enjoy the simplicity

// remember that filename should start with a date and then title (i.e. 2014-04-13-<title>.adoc) 
// if you commit a file with a date in the future it will be published after the first built after that date.
// building locally it will just be shown as a Draft.
