CAUTION: Since JBoss Tools 4.3.0 we require Java 8 for the installation and use of all JBoss Tools, including the Integration Stack tooling.  We still support developing and running applications using older Java runtimes. See more in link:2015-06-23-beta1-for-mars.html#java-8-to-run-eclipse-older-runtimes-ok-for-builds-deployment[Beta1 blog].
