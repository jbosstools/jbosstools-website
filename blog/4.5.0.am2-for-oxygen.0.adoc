Happy to announce 4.5.0.AM2 (Developer Milestone 2) build for Eclipse Oxygen.0.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/oxygen/4.5.0.AM2.html[JBoss Tools 4.5.0 AM2].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.5.0.AM2.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== OpenShift 3

==== OpenShift server and Kubernetes server versions displayed

The OpenShift server and Kubernetes server versions are now displayed in the OpenShift connection properties.
This information is retrieved using an un-authenticated request login to the OpenShift cluster is not required.
This allow user to verify the OpenShift and Kubernetes level when interacting.

Here is an example based on an OpenShift connection against CDK3:

if the cluster is not started or accessible, then no values are displayed:

=== Docker

==== New Security Options

Support has been added when launching commands in a Container to specify a security option profile. This can be done in lieu of specifying privileged mode. For example, to run gdbserver, one can specify "seccomp:unprofiled" to allow ptrace commands to be run by the gdb server.

The Run Image Wizard has been modified to allow specifying an unconfined seccomp profile to replace the default seccomp profile.

Security options are also now shown in the Properties View.

=== Fuse Tooling

==== Bean Support

We are happy to finally announce support for *Beans* (Spring / Blueprint).

Using the Route Editor you can now access Spring / Blueprint Beans in your Camel Context through the *Configurations* tab.

In the *Configurations* tab you can see all global configuration elements of your Camel Context. You can ``Add``, ``Edit`` and ``Delete`` elements using the buttons on the right side.

By clicking the ``Add`` or ``Edit`` button a wizard will be openend to guide you on the creation of the Bean.

In the wizard you can select an existing bean class from your project or create a new bean class. You can also specify constructor arguments and bean properties.
Once created you can then modify the properties of that Bean inside the ``Properties`` view.

=== Freemarker

==== Freemarker component deprecation

The Freemarker component has been marked deprecated as there is no more maintenance on the source code. It is still available in Red Hat Central
and may be removed in the future.


Enjoy!
