== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.3.AM1.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== OpenShift 3

Although our main focus is bug fixes, we continue to work on providing better experience for container based development in JBoss Tools and Developer Studio. Let's go through a few interesting updates here and you can find more details on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.2.AM1.html[the What's New page].

==== Scaling from pod resources

When an application is being deployed to Openshift, it was possible to scale the pod resources from the 
service resource.

However, it was not a very logical choice. So the command is also available at the pod level, leading to better usability.

Enjoy!
