= What's New in JavaScript Tools

JavaScript is extremely popular nowadays and the fact 
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/webtools.jsdt[Eclipse JavaScript Development Tools] supports
JavaScript ECMA3 standard only didn't let us sleep well, so we decided to do something about it. 

First we got to work and fixed tons of issues in Eclipse JavaScript Development Tools to make it usable, then when it 
is good enough we extended it with some good features to make it even better.
