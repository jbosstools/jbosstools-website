== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.4.AM3.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== OpenShift 3

==== Pipeline builds support

Pipeline based builds are now supported by the OpenShift tooling. 
When creating an application, if using a template, if one of the builds is based on pipeline, you can view the detail
of the pipeline:

When your application is deployed, you can see the details of the build configuration for the pipeline based builds:

More to come as we are improving the pipeline support in the OpenShift tooling.

Enjoy!
