== What's an Integration Stack?

*JBoss Tools Integration Stack 4.2.1.Final / JBoss Developer Studio Integration Stack 8.0.1.GA*

The Integration Stack for JBoss Tools Developer Studio is a set of plugins for Eclipse that provides integration tooling for the following frameworks.

=== JBoss Business Process and Rules Development

* link:/features/bpel.html[BPEL Designer] - Orchestrating your business processes.
* link:/features/bpmn2.html[BPMN2 Modeler] - A graphical modeling tool which allows creation and editing of Business Process Modeling Notation diagrams using graphiti.
* link:/features/drools.html[Drools] - A Business Logic integration Platform which provides a unified and integrated platform for Rules, Workflow and Event Processing.
* link:/features/jbpm.html[jBPM] - A flexible Business Process Management (BPM) suite.

=== JBoss Data Virtualization Development

* link:/features/modeshape.html[Modeshape] - A distributed, hierarchical, transactional and consistent data store with support for queries, full-text search, events, versioning, references, and flexible and dynamic schemas. It is very fast, highly available, extremely scalable, and it is 100% open source.
* link:/features/teiiddesigner.html[Teiid Designer] - A visual tool that enables rapid, model-driven definition, integration, management and testing of data services without programming using the Teiid runtime framework.

=== JBoss Integration and SOA Development

*Note - the SOA Development tooling category has both released and early access components.  Consequently, you will see it in both the release install dialog and the early access install dialog.*

* All of the Business Process and Rules Development plugins, plus...
* link:/features/apachecamel.html[Fuse Apache Camel Tooling] - A graphical tool for integrating software components that works with Apache ServiceMix, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel and the FuseSource distributions.
* link:/features/switchyard.html[SwitchYard] - A lightweight service delivery framework providing full lifecycle support for developing, deploying, and managing service-oriented applications.

=== SOA 5.x Development

* link:http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb[JBoss ESB] - An enterprise service bus for connecting enterprise applications and services.
* link:http://docs.jboss.com/jbpm/v3.2/userguide/html_single/[jBPM3] - A flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite - JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.x compatible version.

*All of these components have been verified to work with the same dependencies as JBoss Tools 4.2 and Developer Studio 8.*

== What's Been Updated?

Updates have been made to the Business Process tooling (BPMN2 Modeler), Fuse Tooling and SwitchYard.  See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio_Integration_Stack/8.0/html/8.0.1_Release_Notes/index.html[JBDSIS 8.0.1 Release Notes]

== Installation

=== If you already have JBDSIS 8.0.0 installed...

Simply start jbdevstudio or eclipse-with-jbds, then:

Select Help > Check for Updates

Select the components you'd like to install from the available updates.

=== If you'd like a fresh install...

To install the Integration Stack tools, first install JBoss Developer Studio from the link:https://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio.html[all-in-one installer], bundled and configured out of the box with everything you need to get started. Alternatively, if you already have eclipse-jee-luna installed, you can install link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-luna[JBoss Developer Studio] or link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-tools-luna[JBoss Tools] from the Eclipse Marketplace via *Help > Eclipse Marketplace...*

Once Developer Studio is installed, restart Eclipse and select the Software/Update tab in the JBoss Central view.  The current 8.0.1.GA integration stack is available automatically with the released *JBoss Data Virtualization Development* tooling.  The remainder of the integration tooling is available as *Early Access* so you must check the *Enable Early Access* checkbox in the installer window in order to install.
