== What's an Integration Stack?

Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio Integration Stack is a set of Eclipse-based development tools. It further enhances the IDE functionality provided by JBoss Developer Studio, with plug-ins specifically for use when developing for other Red Hat JBoss products.  It's where DataVirt Tooling, SOA tooling and BRMS tooling are aggregated.  The following frameworks are supported:

=== JBoss Business Process and Rules Development

JBoss Business Process and Rules Development plug-ins provide design, debug and testing tooling for developing business processes for Red Hat JBoss BRMS and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

* link:/features/bpel.html[BPEL Designer] - Orchestrating your business processes.
* link:/features/bpmn2.html[BPMN2 Modeler] - A graphical modeling tool which allows creation and editing of Business Process Modeling Notation diagrams using graphiti.
* link:/features/drools.html[Drools] - A Business Logic integration Platform which provides a unified and integrated platform for Rules, Workflow and Event Processing including KIE.
* link:/features/jbpm.html[jBPM] - A flexible Business Process Management (BPM) suite.

=== JBoss Data Virtualization Development

JBoss Data Virtualization Development plug-ins provide a graphical interface to manage various aspects of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization instances, including the ability to design virtual databases and interact with associated governance repositories.

* link:/features/teiiddesigner.html[Teiid Designer] - A visual tool that enables rapid, model-driven definition, integration, management and testing of data services without programming using the Teiid runtime framework.

=== JBoss Integration and SOA Development

JBoss Integration and SOA Development plug-ins provide tooling for developing, configuring and deploying BRMS and SwitchYard to Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Fuse Fabric containers.

* All of the Business Process and Rules Development plugins plus SwitchYard. Switchyard is deprecated as of this release.
* link:/features/fusetools.html[Fuse Tooling] has moved out of the Integration Stack to be a core part of JBoss Tools and Developer Studio.
