Happy to announce 4.19.1.AM1 (Developer Milestone 1) build for Eclipse 2021-03.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/2021-03/4.19.1.AM1.html[JBoss Tools 4.19.1 AM1].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.19.1.AM1.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.


=== OpenShift

==== Improved OpenShift Application explorer

When the OpenShift cluster has no applications or projects, user is required to create them. However,
it may not be obvious for the user that the corresponding function is available from a sub menu of the
New context menu.

So now, a link will be provided within the tree with an explanation message.

If no projects are available, user will be guided to create one:

If no applications are available in a project, user will be guided to create a new component:

=== Hibernate Tools

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

==== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.32.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.32.Final.



Enjoy!
