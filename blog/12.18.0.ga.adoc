== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar codereadystudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.17 (2020-09) but we recommend
using the latest https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-09/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers[Eclipse 4.17 2020-06 JEE Bundle]
since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

[WARNING]
====
Java11 is now required to run Red Hat Developer Studio or JBoss Tools (this is a requirement from Eclipse 4.17). So make sure to select a Java11 JDK in the installer.
You can still work with pre-Java11 JDK/JRE and projects in the tool.
====

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was an improved tooling for the Quarkus framework, improvements for container based development and bug fixing.

=== OpenShift

==== Devfile based deployments

The Application Explorer view is now based on odo 2.x, which allows deployments
to be based on devfile (developer oriented manifest file). The components from
the default odo registry are listed with legacy S2I components:

It is also now possible to bootstrap from an empty project as the components
from the registry may expose starter projects (sample code that will initialize
your empty project).

=== Quarkus

==== Support for codestarts in New Quarkus project wizard

code.quarkus.io has added a new option codestart that allows extension that support
this new feature to contribute sample code in the generated project. It is enabled
by default and is accessible from the second step in the wizard:

=== Server Tools

==== Wildfly 22 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 22.

=== Hibernate Tools

==== Hibernate Runtime Provider Updates

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

===== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.27.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.27.Final.

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.20.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.20.Final.


=== And more...

You can find more noteworthy updates in on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.17.0.Final.html[this page].
