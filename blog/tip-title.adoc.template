:page-author: maxandersen
// page-tags: used to categorize the blog entry. Try not going overboard here.
// use components from jira, try keep them short and not require spaces. 
// Note: jbosscentral is a magic tag that makes it show up on jbosscentral

Setup the context for the tip - keep it short and sweet.

This is not a blog - should preferably fit on a single page or even paragraph.

If the tip has multiple steps create a *small* (<10-30s), zoomed in and
without sound.

 }

Put images inside the `images` folder with a unique name, all lowercase.

=== Menus, keyboard and buttons have their own style

When using menus like menu:Preferences[Guide > The > User], keyboard
shortcuts like kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+P] or even buttons like btn:[Ok] then
there is a style for it.


// remember that filename should start with a date and then title (i.e. 2014-04-13-tip-1-<title>.adoc) 
// if you commit a file with a date in the future it will be published after the first built after that date.
// building locally it will just be shown as a Draft.
