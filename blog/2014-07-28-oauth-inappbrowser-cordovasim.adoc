In this article I'm happy to introduce you the http://oauth.net/[OAuth] authorization via Phonegap's https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser[inAppBrowser] plugin with https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-aerogear/tree/master/cordovasim[CordovaSim]. 

I was inspired to write this blog after reading a great article about http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/google-api-oauth-with-phonegaps-inappbrowser.html[Google API OAuth with PhoneGap's InAppBrowser] by Michael Dellanoce. I also want to spill the beans about new CordovaSim's features like: *JavaFx web engine*, *hybrid app debugging* and *eclipse console logging*.

== Overview
http://oauth.net/[OAuth] is an open standard for authorization. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner, or end-user. PhoneGap Developers use https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/doc/index.md[inAppBrowser's API] to show the OAuth consent page.

== Demo 
https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-aerogear/tree/master/cordovasim[CordovaSim] supports inAppBrowser plugin and handles OAuth authorization. Here is a short https://vimeo.com/98135061[video] with OAuth demo and brand-new CordovaSim's features (https://github.com/mdellanoce/google-api-oauth-phonegap/tree/master[source code] is also taken from the Michael Dellanoce's article):

== How to give it a go?
The sample should work with `JBoss Tools 4.2.0 Beta3` release and the following. 
[square]
* Clone the demo https://github.com/mdellanoce/google-api-oauth-phonegap/tree/master[project]
* File -> Import -> Import Cordova Project
* Right click on the project -> Properties -> Hybrid Mobile Engine -> Download -> 3.4.0 (select as default engine)
* Create a https://console.developers.google.com/[Google Developers Console] project
* Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* to index.js (lines 80-81) of the hybrid project
* Right click on the project -> Run As.. -> Run with CordovaSim

== Conclusion
We are trying our best to make CordovaSim as good as possible. Users feedback is what we are seeking for now. We are looking forward to hearing your comments / remarks! +
Have fun!
