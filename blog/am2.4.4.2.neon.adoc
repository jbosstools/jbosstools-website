Happy to announce 4.4.2.AM2 (Developer Milestone 2) build for Eclipse Neon.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/neon/4.4.2.AM2.html[JBoss Tools 4.4.2 AM2].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.2.AM2.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== OpenShift 3

Although our main focus is bug fixes, we continue to work on providing better experience for container based development in JBoss Tools and Developer Studio. Let's go through a few interesting updates here and you can find more details on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.2.AM2.html[the What's New page].

==== Common namespace template support

Common namespace was link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.2.AM1.html#openshift[added] but templates were still loaded from the hardcoded `openshift` namespace.
They are now loaded from the configured common namespace (which still default to `openshift`)

==== User controlled hostname when creating routes

When an application is being deployed to Openshift, a route is optionally created if required by the user.
Openshift/CDK used to create an http://xip.io[xip.io] based hostname. User can now set its own hostname.
This allows for both changing the DNS to local IP provider (http://nip.io[nip.io]) or using you own enterprise DNS naming strategy.

The hostname can be accessed from the Services and Routing Settings page when deploying an application:

=== Forge

The included Forge runtime is now 3.3.2.Final. Read the official announcement http://forge.jboss.org/news/jboss-forge-3.3.2.final-is-here[here].

==== New Menu in Forge Console view to trigger the Command Selection Dialog

Now it's possible to bring the Command Selection Dialog menu (invoked when Ctrl/Command + 4 is pressed) by choosing the "Open Command Selection Dialog..." menu item in the Forge Console view.
