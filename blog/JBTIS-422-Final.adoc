== What's an Integration Stack?

The Integration Stack for JBoss Tools Developer Studio is a set of plugins for Eclipse that provides integration tooling for the following frameworks.

=== JBoss Fuse Development

*Note - the Fuse Development tooling category has both released and early access components.  Consequently, you will see it in both the release installation dialog and the early access installation dialog.*

* link:/features/apachecamel.html[Fuse Tooling] - Tools related to integrating and developing software components that work with Apache ServiceMix, ActiveMQ and Camel - support for Fuse.

=== JBoss Business Process and Rules Development

* link:/features/bpel.html[BPEL Designer] - Orchestrating your business processes.
* link:/features/bpmn2.html[BPMN2 Modeler] - A graphical modeling tool which allows creation and editing of Business Process Modeling Notation diagrams using graphiti.

* link:/features/jbpm.html[jBPM] - A flexible Business Process Management (BPM) suite.

=== JBoss Data Virtualization Development

* link:/features/modeshape.html[Modeshape] - A distributed, hierarchical, transactional and consistent data store with support for queries, full-text search, events, versioning, references, and flexible and dynamic schemas. It is very fast, highly available, extremely scalable, and it is 100% open source.
* link:/features/teiiddesigner.html[Teiid Designer] - A visual tool that enables rapid, model-driven definition, integration, management and testing of data services without programming using the Teiid runtime framework.

=== JBoss Integration and SOA Development

*Note - the SOA Development tooling category has both released and early access components.  Consequently, you will see it in both the release install dialog and the early access install dialog.*

* All of the Business Process and Rules Development plugins, plus...
* link:/features/apachecamel.html[Fuse Apache Camel Tooling] - A graphical tool for integrating software components that works with Apache ServiceMix, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel and the FuseSource distributions.
* link:/features/switchyard.html[SwitchYard] - A lightweight service delivery framework providing full lifecycle support for developing, deploying, and managing service-oriented applications.

=== SOA 5.x Development

* link:http://docs.jboss.com/jbpm/v3.2/userguide/html_single/[jBPM3] - A flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite - JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.x compatible version.

*All of these components have been verified to work with the same dependencies as JBoss Tools 4.2 and Developer Studio 8.*

== What's Been Updated?

Updates have been made to the Business Process tooling, Fuse Tooling, Data Virtualization and SwitchYard.  See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio_Integration_Stack/8.0/html/8.0.2_Release_Notes/index.html[JBDSIS 8.0.2 Release Notes]

=== Released Tooling Highlights

=== JBoss Fuse Development Highlights

* New projects can now be given an arbitrary name. Previously, artifactId was used as the project name without the possibility to alter it.

* Camel Debugger has been added. It allows to set, edit and remove breakpoints in the Design view. Camel 2.12 or higher is required for this functionality.
* The Servers view now provides access to JMX when the server is running. Fuse-specific nodes are now also visible in the Servers view.
* New and reworked server adapters have been added for Apache Karaf, Apache ServiceMix, and JBoss Fuse.
* The previous deployment mechanism using hotfolder, JMX node and fabric8 nodes has been replaced by a publishing logic in the Servers view.
* Project running on a server are now automatically redeployed when changed locally.
* The Servers view now shows deployed projects and their bundle state.
* The deploy, redeploy and undeploy operations are now all done in the Servers view.
* Server credentials are now stored in the Eclipse secure storage.
* A new editor palette drawer has been added for the most frequently used Camel components.
* New custom component properties pages have been added.
* Fabric8 tooling is now DEPRECATED and will be removed with the release of Fuse Tooling 8.0.0 (released in sync with JBoss Fuse 7.0.0).
