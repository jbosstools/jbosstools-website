== What's an Integration Stack?

The Integration Stack for JBoss Tools Developer Studio is a set of plugins for Eclipse that provides integration tooling for the following frameworks.

=== JBoss Fuse Development

*Note - the Fuse Development tooling category has both released and early access components.  Consequently, you will see it in both the release installation dialog and the early access installation dialog.*

* link:/features/apachecamel.html[Fuse Tooling] - Tools related to integrating and developing software components that work with Apache ServiceMix, ActiveMQ and Camel - support for Fuse.

=== JBoss Business Process and Rules Development

It is very fast, highly available, extremely scalable, and it is 100% open source.
