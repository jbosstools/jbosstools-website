== Installation

Red Hat Developer Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/overview/[Red Hat Developer product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar devstudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) Developer Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.9 (2018-09) but we recommend
using the latest http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-09/r/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers[Eclipse 4.9 2018-09 JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat Developer Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was on adoption of Java11, improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
Eclipse 2018-09 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2018-09 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.

=== OpenShift 3

==== Inner loop for Spring Boot applications

Although Spring Boot applications were already supported by the OpenShift server adapter,
the global developer experience has been enhanced. Let's complete the full workflow.

===== Bootstrapping your Spring Boot applications

A new generator (wizard) has been added to JBoss Tools. It's called the Launcher
application as it's based on the fabric8-launcher project. When you launch JBoss
Tools, you should see this in Red Hat Central:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop.png[]

Click on the ```Launcher application``` link and the following wizard will appear:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop1.png[]

Switch the ```Mission``` field to ```rest-http ``` as we want to generate a simple
REST application and switch the ```Runtime``` field to ```spring-boot current-community```
as we want to generate a Spring Boot based application.

Then set the ```Project name``` field to ```myfirstrestapp``` and leave other fields as-is.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop2.png[]

Click the ```Finish``` button. A new project will be added to your local workspace.
It may takes some times as Maven will resolve all the Spring Boot dependencies and
thus need to download them from the Internet.

When the project is build and if you expand the ```myfirstrestapp``` in the ```Project explorer```
window, you should see this:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop3.png[]

===== Storing your source code on GitHub

As OpenShift builder images retrieves code on a Git repository, we first need to push
the just generated application code to GitHub. The following section assumes that you
created a repository called ```myfirstrestapp``` under your GitHub account.

We will first create a local Git repository for our application code then push it to
GitHub.

Select the ```myfirstrestapp``` project and right click the ```Team -> Share project...```
menu item:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop4.png[]

Then select the ```Git``` repository type and click the ```Next``` button:

image::images/spring-boot-inner-loop5.png[]

Select the ```Use or create repository in parent folder of project``` checkbox
then select the ```myfirstrestapp``` project:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop6.png[]
 
Click on the ```Create repository``` button and the on the ```Finish``` button.

The ```Project explorer``` view is updated:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop7.png[]

Select the ```myfirstrestapp``` project and right click
the ```Team -> Show in Repositories View``` menu item. A new view
called ```Git Repositories``` will be added to the perspective:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop8.png[]

Inside this view, select the ```Remotes``` node and right click
the ```Create Remote...``` menu item. The following dialog will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop9.png[]

Click on the ```OK``` button, the following dialog will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop10.png[]

Click on the ```Change...``` button and enter ```git@github.com:GITHUB_USER/myfirstrestapp```
in the ```URI``` field, replacing ```GITHUB_USER``` by your real GitHub user name.

Then click the ```Finish``` button and then on the ```Save``` button.

====== Pushing code to GitHub

We are now ready to push our application code to GitHub. Select the ```myfirstrestapp``` project
in the ```Project explorer``` view, right click the ```Team -> Commit``` menu item. A new view
call ```Git Staging``` will open:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop11.png[]

Double click on the view title to maximize it:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop12.png[]

Select all the files listed in the ```Unstaged changes``` list and click the '+' button. The
files will then move to the ```Staged Changes``` list:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop13.png[]

Enter a commit message (ex 'Initial version') and click the ```Commit and Push...``` button.
the following dialog will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop14.png[]

Click on the ```Next``` button:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop15.png[]

Click on the ```Finish``` button to start the push operation.

A dialog with the result of the push operation will be displayed. Click the ```OK``` to
dismiss it.

====== Add Spring Boot Devtools to the packaged application

In order to support live update on an OpenShift cluster, we must add Spring Boot
DevTools to our Spring Boot application.

Open the ```pom.xml``` in the  ```myfirstrestapp```. Locate the ```spring-boot-maven-plugin```
and add the following section:

```xml
            <configuration>
              <excludeDevtools>false</excludeDevtools>
            </configuration>
```

The whole ```spring-boot-maven-plugin``` section is given below:

```xml
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>repackage</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <excludeDevtools>false</excludeDevtools>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
```

Close and save the ```pom.xml``` file.

Push the change to GitHub: select the ```Team -> Commit...``` with a new commit
message (ex 'With DevTools')

===== Deploy the application on OpenShift

Before we can deploy the application on OpenShift, we must first create an ImageStream on
our OpenShift cluster. The reason is that the Spring Boot support relies on S2I builds
that will explode the Spring Boot uber JAR when Spring Boot DevTools is present. As this
is not supported by all Java based S2I images, we will use one that supports it, ie fabric8/s2i-java:2.2

First, in the ```myfirstrestapp``` project, create a new JSON file called ```springboot.json```
and set the content of this file to:

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "image.openshift.io/v1",
    "kind": "ImageStream",
	"metadata": {
		"name": "springboot"
	},
    "spec": {
        "lookupPolicy": {
            "local": false
        },
        "tags": [
            {
                "annotations": {
					"tags": "builder,java"
				},
                "from": {
                    "kind": "DockerImage",
                    "name": "registry.access.redhat.com/fuse7/fuse-java-openshift:1.1"
                },
                "importPolicy": {},
                "name": "1.1",
                "referencePolicy": {
                    "type": "Source"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Then, from the OpenShift explorer view, select the OpenShift connection for your cluster (if you don't have
one already defined, you must define it), right click on the ```New -> Resource...``` menu item and the
following dialog will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop16.png[]

You can select the OpenShift project you want to work with and then click on
the ```Browse Workspace...``` button and select the ```springboot.json``` file
in the ```myfirstrestapp``` project:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop17.png[]

Click the ```OK``` and ```Finish``` buttons. The new ImageStream will be created and a status
dialog will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop18.png[]

====== Create the application on OpenShift

We're now ready to create the application on the OpenShift cluster. Select the OpenShift
connection, right click the ```New -> Application...``` menu item. If you scroll down the
list, you should see the ```springboot``` ImageStream we just created:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop19.png[]

Select this ImageStream and click the ```Next``` button:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop20.png[]

Enter ````myfirstrestapp``` in the ````Name````
field, ```https://github.com/GITHUB_USER/myfirstrestapp``` in the ```Git Repository URL```
field, replacing ```GITHUB_USER``` by your real GitHub user name and click
the ```Next``` button.

On the ```Deployment Configuration & Scalability``` dialog, click the ````Next``` button.

On the ```Service & Routing Settings```, select the ```8778-tcp``` port and click
the ```Edit``` button, change the 8787 value to 8080:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop21.png[]

Click the ```OK``` button then the ```Finish``` button.

The list of OpenShift resources created will be displayed by a dialog:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop22.png[]

Click the ```OK``` button to dismiss it and when asked to import the application
code, click the ```Cancel``` button as we already have the source code.

After the build is run (this may takes several minutes as the Maven build will download
lots of dependencies), you should see a running pod:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop23.png[]

===== Inner loop setup

We are going to synchronize the local Eclipse project with the remote OpenShift pod. Each time a file
will be modified locally, then the pod will be updated accordingly.

Select the running pod in the ```OpenShift explorer```, right click the ```Server Adapter...``` menu
item, the following dialog will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop24.png[]

Click the ```OK``` button, the initial synchronization will be started and
the ```Servers``` view will be displayed:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop25.png[]

We've not setup the synchronization between our local Eclipse project and the remote
OpenShift project. Each modification done locally will be reported on the remote
OpenShift cluster.

Let's modify our local application code and see the changes applied almost
instantly:

Edit the file ```src/main/java/io/openshift/booster/service/Greeting.java```
in the ```myfirstrestapp``` project and change the ```FORMAT``` string
value from ```Hello, %s!``` to ```Hello, Mr %s!``` and save the file.

The file should be now:

```java

 */
package io.openshift.booster.service;

// tag::snippet-greeting[]
public class Greeting {

    public static final String FORMAT = "Hello, Mr %s!";

    private final String content;

    public Greeting() {
        this.content = null;
    }

    public Greeting(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
// end::snippet-greeting[]
```

Then, in the ``ÒpenShift explorer``` view, select the ```myfirstrestapp``` deployment
and select the ````Show In -> Web Browser``` menu item and once the web browser is
displayed, ckick the ```Invoke``` button, you should see the following view:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/spring-boot-inner-loop26.png[]

You've just experienced the inner loop on your Spring Boot application: any change done
locally is reported and testable almost immedialtely on your OpenShift cluster.

You can restart the deployment in debug mode and you'll be able to remote debug your
Spring Boot application. Amazing, no ?


=== Server tools

==== Wildfly 14 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 14. It adds support for Java EE 8. 

=== Hibernate Tools

==== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.6.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.6.Final.

The Hibernate 5.2 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.2.17.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.2.11.Final.

The Hibernate 5.1 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.1.16.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.1.10.Final.


=== Fuse Tooling

==== REST Viewer becoming an editor

Previously, there was a REST editor which was read-only. It is useful to have a great overview of already defined Camel REST DSL definitions. Now the editor and its related properties tab are also providing editing capabilities allowing to develop faster.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/fusetools/images/fuse-editor-rest-tab-properties-11.1.0.am2.jpg[Fully Editable REST Editor]

You can now:

* Create and delete REST Configurations
* Create and delete new REST Elements
* Create and delete new REST Operations
* Edit properties for a selected REST Element in the Properties view
* Edit properties for a selected REST Operation in the Properties view

In addition, we've improved the look and feel by fixing the scrolling capabilities of the REST Element and REST Operations lists. 

=== Java Developement Tools (JDT)

==== Java Editor

===== Improved Breadcrumb for Dark theme

The *Breadcrumb* in the *Java Editor* now uses a dark background in the Dark theme.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/breadcrumb_dark_and_light.png[]

In the Light theme, the *Breadcrumb* uses a flat look style instead of a gradient.

===== Quick fix to create abstract methods

The existing quick fix to create missing methods has been improved to create abstract
method declarations. The option only appears when the target class is an abstract class.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/quickfix_create_abstract_method_1.png[]

===== Quick fix to convert to static import

A new quick fix has been implemented that allows the user to convert static field accesses
and static methods to use a static import. It's also possible to replace all occurrences at
the same time.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/quickfix_convert_to_static_import.png[]

==== Java Code Generation

===== Improved hashCode() and equals() generation

A new option in the *Source > Generate hashCode() and equals()...* tool allows you to create
implementations using the Java 7 ```Objects.equals``` and ```Objects.hash``` methods.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/hashcode-equals-dialog.png[]

The above setup generates the following code:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/hashcode-equals-generation.png[]

Additionally, arrays are handled more cleverly. The generation prefers the ```Arrays.deepHashCode```
and ```Arrays.deepEquals``` methods when dealing with ```Object[]```, ```Serializable[]```
and ```Cloneable[]``` or any type variables extending these types.

==== Java Views and Dialogs

===== Quick Fix for JRE Compiler Compliance Problem Marker

A new quick fix is provided on the *JRE Compiler Compilance* problem marker which is created
when the compiler compliance does not match the JRE being used. This quick fix provides the
option of opening the *Compiler Compliance* page of the project to fix the issue.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/quickfix_open_cc_page.png[]

Selecting this option opens the *Compiler Compliance* property page for the specified project
as shown below.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/quickfix_cc_page.png[]

===== Open Type dialog now always shows the full path

The *Open Type* dialog now always shows the full path of all the matching items.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/open_type_full_path.png[]

==== Java Formatter

===== Keep simple loops in one line

New formatter settings have been added that make it possible to keep the bodies
of simple loops (without braces) in the same line as their headers, similar to
previously existing setting for simple 'if' statements. Different kind of loops
('for', 'while', 'do while') can be controlled independently.

The settings can be found in the profile editor under
*New Lines > In control statements > Simple Loops*.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/formatter-compact-loops.png[]

There's also a new setting to control how these loops should be handled if they
exceed the maximum line width. It's located under
*Line Wrapping > Wrapping settings > Statements > Compact loops ('for', 'while', 'do while')*.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/formatter-compact-loops-wrap.png[]

===== Align items in columns

A feature previously known as *align fields in columns* has been expanded and
can now be used for *variable declarations* and *assignment statements* as well.

An option has also been added to always *align with spaces*, even if tabs are
used for general indentation. This is very similar to the *Use spaces to indent wrapped lines*
option and is useful to make the code look good in editors with differing tab width.

All the settings related to aligning are now in the new preferences subsection:
 *Indentation > Align items in columns*.
 
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/formatter-align-in-columns.png[]
 
==== Debug

===== Timeout for result of step operation

Observing the result of step operations may slow down execution, which may be
unusable if the step takes long already. Therefore a timeout (default: 7000 ms)
has been introduced after which the observation mechanism is disabled until the
end of the step operation. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/result_timeout_537142.png[]

The timeout can be configured
in *Preferences > Java > Debug > Don't show if step operation takes longer than (ms)*.

===== Option to hide running threads in Debug view

A new option has been introduced in the *Debug* view to show or hide running threads.

Hiding running threads can be useful when debugging heavily multithreaded application,
when it is difficult to find threads stopped at breakpoints among hundreds or thousands
of running threads.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/hide-running-threads.png[]

===== Show Command Line button in Launch Configuration

A new button *Show Command Line* has been added in the *Java Launch Configuration*
dialog.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/show_command_line.png[]

Clicking the button will open a dialog to show the command line used for launching
the application.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/show_command_line_detail.png[]

===== Option to disable thread name changes in Debug View

Thread name changes in the debuggee JVM are reflected in the *Debug* View.
A VM option can now be used to disable this behavior, in case the JVM communication
necessary for the name updates is not desired.

The functionality can be disabled by specifying the following VM option
```
-Dorg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.model.ThreadNameChangeListener.disable=true
```

===== Support for long classpath/modulepath

Classpath and/or modulepath are now shortened if they are longer than current
operating system limits.

If a temporary jar is needed to shorten the classpath (Java 8 and previous versions),
a dialog is shown asking for confirmation.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/enable-classpathonly-dialog.png[]

The option *Use temporary jar to specify classpath (to avoid classpath length limitations)*
is available in the *Classpath* tab of the *Run/Debug Configuration* dialog.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.9/images/enable-classpathonly-option.png[]




=== And more...

You can find more noteworthy updates in on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.9.0.Final.html[this page].

== What is next?

Having JBoss Tools 4.9.0 and Red Hat Developer Studio 12.9 out we are already working on the next release for Eclipse 2018-12.

Enjoy!
