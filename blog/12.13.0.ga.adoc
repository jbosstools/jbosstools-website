== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar codereadystudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.13 (2019-09) but we recommend
using the latest https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-09/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers[Eclipse 4.13 2019-09 JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
Eclipse 2019-09 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2019-09 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.

=== OpenShift

==== OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 support

With the new OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.2 now available (see this 
https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-expands-kubernetes-developer-experience-newest-version-red-hat-openshift-4[article,window=_blank]),
even if this is a major shift compared to OCP 3, JBoss Tools is compatible with
this major release in a transparent way. Just define your connection to your
OCP 4.2 based cluster as you did before for an OCP 3 cluster, and use the tooling !

==== CodeReady Containers 1.0 Server Adapter

A new server adapter has been added to support the next generation of CodeReady Containers 1.0.
While the server adapter itself has limited functionality, it is able to start and stop the CodeReady Containers virtual machine via its crc binary.
Simply hit Ctrl+3 (Cmd+3 on OSX) and type `new server`, that will bring up a command to setup a new server.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter.png[width=600]

Enter `crc` in the filter textbox.

You should see the *Red Hat CodeReady Containers 1.0* server adapter.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter1.png[width=600]

Select *Red Hat CodeReady Containers 1.0* and click the *Next* button.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter2.png[width=600]

All you have to do is set the location of the CodeReady Containers crc binary file, the pull secret file location (the pull secret file can be downloaded from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned).

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter3.png[width=600]

Once youâ€™re finished, a new CodeReady Containers server adapter will then be created and visible in the Servers view.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter4.png[width=600]

Once the server is started, a new OpenShift connection should appear in the OpenShift
Explorer View, allowing the user to quickly create a new Openshift application and begin developing their AwesomeApp in a highly-replicatable environment.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/crc-server-adapter5.png[width=600]


=== Server tools

==== Wildfly 18 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 18. It adds support for Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 8. 


==== EAP 7.3 Beta Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with EAP 7.3 Beta.

=== Hibernate Tools

==== Hibernate Runtime Provider Updates

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

===== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.7.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.7.Final.

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.13.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.13.Final.


=== Platform

==== Views, Dialogs and Toolbar

===== Quick Search

The new *Quick Search* dialog provides a convenient, simple and fast way to run a textual search
across your workspace and jump to matches in your code. The dialog provides a quick overview
showing matching lines of text at a glance. It updates as quickly as you can type and allows
for quick navigation using only the keyboard. A typical workflow starts by pressing the keyboard
shortcut *Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L* (or *Cmd+Alt+Shift+L* on Mac). Typing a few letters updates the search
result as you type. Use *Up-Down* arrow keys to select a match, then hit *Enter* to open it in an
editor.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/quick-search.png[]

===== Save editor when Project Explorer has focus

You can now save the active editor even when the *Project Explorer* has focus. In cases where an
extension contributes *Saveables* to the Project Explorer, the extension is honored and the save
action on the Project Explorer will save the provided saveable item instead of the active editor.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/save_project_explorer.png[]

===== "Show In" context menu available for normal resources

The *Show In* context menu is now available for an element inside a resource project on the
*Project Explorer*.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/showin_project_explorer.png[]

===== Show colors for additions and deletions in Compare viewer

In simple cases such as a 2-way comparison or a 3-way comparison with no merges and conflicts, the
*Compare Viewer* now shows different colors, depending on whether text has been added, removed or
modified. The default colors are green, red and black respectively.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/compare-editor-colors.png[]

The colors can be customized through usual theme customization approaches, including using related
entries in the *Colors and Fonts preference* page.

===== Editor status line shows more selection details

The status line for *Text Editors* now shows the cursor position, and when the editor has something
selected, shows the number of characters in the selection as well. This also works in the block
selection mode.

These two new additions to the status line can be disabled via the *General > Editors > Text Editors*
preference page.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/selection-count.png[]
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/selection-offset.png[]

===== Shorter dialog text

Several dialog texts have been shortened. This allows you to capture the important information faster.

Previously

Now

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/short-dialog.png[]

===== Close project via middle-click

In the *Project Explorer*, you can now close a project using middle-click.


==== Debug

===== Improved usability of Environment tab in Launch Configurations

In the *Environment Tab* of the *Launch Configuration* dialog, you can now double-click on an environment
variable name or value and start editing it directly from the table.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/environment-variable-inline-editing.png[]

Right-clicking on the environment variable table now opens a context menu, allowing for quick addition,
removal, copying, and pasting of environment variables.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/environment-variable-context-menu.png[]

===== Show Command Line for external program launch

The *External Tools Configuration* dialog for launching an external program now supports the
*Show Command Line* button.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/external-tool-showcommandline.png[]

==== Preferences

===== Close editors automatically when reaching 99 open editors

The preference to close editors automatically is now enabled by default. It will be triggered when you have
opened 99 files. If you continue to open editors, old editors will be closed to protect you from performance
problems. You can modify this setting in the *Preferences* dialog via the *General > Editors > Close* editors
automatically preference.

===== In-table color previews for Text Editor appearance color options

You can now see all the colors currently being used in *Text Editors* from the Appearance color options table,
located in the *Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editor* page.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/text-editors-color-intable.png[]

===== Automatic detection of UI freezes in the Eclipse SDK

The Eclipse SDK has been configured to show stack traces for UI freezes in the *Error Log* view by default
for new workspaces. You can use this information to identify and report slow parts of the Eclipse IDE.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/freeze-event.png[]

You can disable the monitoring or tweak its settings via the options in the *General > UI Responsiveness
Monitoring* preference page as shown below.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/ui-monitor-preference.png[]

==== Themes and Styling 

===== Start automatically in dark theme based on OS theme

On Linux and Mac, Eclipse can now start automatically in dark theme when the OS theme is dark. This works by
default, that is on a new workspace or when the user has not explicitly set or changed the theme in Eclipse.

===== Display of Help content respects OS theme

More and more operating systems provide a system wide dark theme. Eclipse now respects this system wide theme
setting when the Eclipse help content is displayed in an external browser. A prerequisite for this is a browser
that supports the prefers-color-scheme CSS media query.

As of writing this the following browser versions support it:

- Firefox version 67
- Chrome version 76
- Safari version 12.1

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/help_system_dark.png[]

===== Help content uses high resolution icons

The *Help System* as well as the help content of the *Eclipse Platform*, the
*Java Development Tooling* and the *Plug-in Development Environment* now use high resolution icons.
They are now crisp on high resolution displays and also looks much better in the dark theme.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/help_system_high_res.png[]

===== Improved dark theme on Windows

Labels, Sections, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, FormTexts and Sashes on forms now use the correct background
color in the dark mode on windows.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/correct_backgrounds.png[]


==== General Updates

===== Interactive performance

Interactive performance has been further improved in this release and several UI freezes have been fixed.

===== Show key bindings when command is invoked

For presentations, screen casts and learning purposes, it is very helpful to show the corresponding key
binding when a command is invoked. When the command is invoked (via a key binding or menu interaction)
the key binding, the command's name and description are shown on the screen.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/show_key_bindings.png[]

You can activate this in the *Preferences* dialog via the _Show key binding when command is invoked_
check box on the *General > Keys* preference page. To toggle this setting quickly the command
'Toggle Whether to Show Key Binding' can be used (e.g. via the quick access).
 
=== Java Developement Tools (JDT)

==== Java 13 Support

===== Java 13

Java 13 is out and Eclipse JDT supports Java 13 for 4.13 via Marketplace.

The release notably includes the following Java 13 features:

- JEP 354: Switch Expressions (Preview).
- JEP 355: Text Blocks (Preview).

Please note that these are preview language feature and hence enable preview option should be on. For an informal introduction of the support, please refer to Java 13 Examples wiki.

==== Java Views and Dialogs

===== Synchronize standard and error output in console

The Eclipse *Console view* currently can not ensure that mixed standard and error output is shown in the
same order as it is produced by the running process. For Java applications the launch configuration
*Common Tab* now provides an option to merge standard and error output. This ensures that standard and error
output is shown in the same order it was produced but at the same time disables the individual coloring of
error output.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/merge-process-output.png[]

==== Java Editor

===== Convert to enhanced 'for' loop using Collections

The Java quickfix/cleanup *Convert to enhanced 'for' loop* is now offered on ```for``` loops that are iterating
through Collections. The loop must reference the ```size``` method as part of the condition and if accessing
elements in the body, must use the ```get``` method. All other Collection methods other than ```isEmpty```
invalidate the quickfix being offered.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/foreachcollectionbefore.png[]
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/foreachcollectionquickfix.png[]
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/foreachcollectionafter.png[]

===== Initialize 'final' fields

A Java quickfix is now offered to initialize an uninitialized ```final``` field in the class constructor.
The fix will initialize a ```String``` to the empty string, a numeric base type to 0, and for class fields it initializes them using their default constructor if available or ```null``` if no default constructor exists.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/finalquickfix1.png[]
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/finalquickfix2.png[]

===== Autoboxing and Unboxing

Use Autoboxing and Unboxing when possible. These features are enabled only for Java 5 and higher.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/autoboxing-unboxing-feature.png[]

===== Improved redundant modifier removal

*Remove redundant modifier* now also removes useless ```abstract``` modifier on the interfaces.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/abstract-removal-feature.png[]

For the given code:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/abstract-removal-before.png[]

You get this:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/abstract-removal-after.png[]

===== Javadoc comment generation for module

Adding a Javadoc comment to a Java module (module-info.java) will result in automatic annotations
being added per the new module comment preferences.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/modulejavadocprefs.png[]

The ```$(tags)``` directive will add ```@uses``` and ```@provides``` tags for all *uses* and *provides*
module statements.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/modulejavadoc.png[]

===== Chain Completion Code Assist

Code assist for "Chain Template Proposals" will be available. These will traverse reachable local variables,
fields, and methods, to produce a chain whose return type is compatible with the expected type in a
particular context.

The preference to enable the feature can be found in the Advanced sub-menu of the Content Assist menu group
(*Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Advanced*) .

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/chain-completion.png[]

==== Java Formatter

===== Remove excess blank lines

All the settings in the *Blank lines* section can now be configured to **remove excess blank lines**,
effectively taking precedence over the _Number of empty lines to preserve_ setting. Each setting has its own
button to turn the feature on, right next to its number control. The button is enabled only if the selected
number of lines is smaller than the __Number of empty lines to preserve__, because otherwise any excess lines
are removed anyway.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/formatter-remove-excess-blank-lines.png[]

===== Changes in blank lines settings

There's quite a lot of changes in the *Blank lines* section of the formatter profile.

Some of the existing subsections and settings are now phrased differently to better express their function:

- The _Blank lines within class declarations_ subsection is now _Blank lines within type declaration_
- _Before first declaration_ is now _Before first member declaration_
- _Before declarations of the same kind_ is now _Between member declarations of different kind_
- _Before member class declarations_ is now _Between member type declarations_
- _Before field declarations_ is now _Between field declarations_
- _Before method declarations_ is now _Between method/constructor declarations_

More importantly, a few new settings have been added to support more places where the number of empty lines can be controlled:

- _After last member declaration_ in a type (to complement previously existing _Before first member declaration_
setting)
- _Between abstract method declarations_ in a type (these cases were previously handled by __Between
method/constructor declarations__)
- _At end of method/constructor body_ (to complement previously existing _At beginning of method/constructor
body_ setting)
- _At beginning of code block_ and _At end of code block_
- _Before statement with code block_ and _After statement with code block_
- _Between statement groups in 'switch'_

Most of the new settings have been put in a new subsection **Blank lines within method/constructor
declarations**.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/formatter-new-blank-lines-settings.png[]

==== JUnit

===== JUnit 5.5.1

JUnit 5.5.1 is here and Eclipse JDT has been updated to use this version.

==== Debug

===== Enhanced support for --patch-module during launch

The *Java Launch Configuration* now supports patching of different modules by different sources during the
launch. This can be verified in the *Override Dependencies...* dialog in the *Dependencies* tab in a
Java Launch Configuration.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/launch-dependencies.png[]
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.13/images/enhanced-patch-module.png[]

==== Java Build

===== Full build on JDT core preferences change

Manually changing the settings file *.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs* of a project will result in a
full project build, if the workspace auto-build is on. For example, pulling different settings from a git
repository or generating the settings with a tool will now trigger a build. Note that this includes
timestamp changes, even if actual settings file contents were not changed.

For the 4.13 release, it is possible to disable this new behavior with the VM property:
**-Dorg.eclipse.disableAutoBuildOnSettingsChange=true**. It is planned to remove this VM property in a future release.




=== And more...

You can find more noteworthy updates in on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.13.0.Final.html[this page].

== What is next?

Having JBoss Tools 4.13.0 and Red Hat CodeReady Studio 12.13 out we are already working on the next release for Eclipse 2019-12.

Enjoy!
