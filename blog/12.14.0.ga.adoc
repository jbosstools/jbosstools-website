== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar codereadystudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.14 (2019-12) but we recommend
using the latest https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-12/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers[Eclipse 4.14 2019-12 JEE Bundle]
since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was a new tooling for the Quarkus framework, improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
Eclipse 2019-12 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2019-12 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.

=== OpenShift

==== OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 support

With the new OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.3 now available (see this 
https://blog.openshift.com/introducing-red-hat-openshift-4-3-to-enhance-kubernetes-security/[article,window=_blank]),
JBoss Tools is compatible with
this major release in a transparent way. Just define your connection to your
OCP 4.3 based cluster as you did before for an OCP 3 cluster, and use the tooling !

==== New OpenShift Application Explorer view

A new OpenShift Application Explorer window has been added in addition to the OpenShift Explorer. It is based on
https://github.com/openshift/odo/[OpenShift Do,,window=_blank]. It provides a different and simplified
user experience allowing easy and rapid feedback through 
inner loop and debugging.

Let's see it in action.

===== Opening the OpenShift Application Explorer view

If you opened a brand new workspace, you should see the
OpenShift Application Explorer view in the list of views
available on the botton part of the screen:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer.png[width=600]

If you don't see the view being listed, you can open it
through the ```Window --> Show View --> Other``` menu,
enter ```open``` in the filter text box and then select
 ```OpenShift Application Explorer```:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer1.png[width=600]

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer2.png[width=600]

Expanding the root node will display the list of projects
available on the cluster:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer3.png[width=600]

===== Java based micro service

We will show how to deploy a Java based microservice and
how to use the various features. But we first need to load
the component source code in our workspace. Thanks to the 
launcher wizard, we can do that easilly. Try ```Ctrl+N```
and select the ```Launcher project``` wizard:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer4.png[width=600]

Then click the ```Next``` button:

Select ```rest-http``` in the ```Mission``` field,
 ```vert.x community``` in the ```Runtime``` field,
 ```myservice``` in the ```Project name``` field:
 
image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer5.png[width=600]

Then click the ```Finish``` button: a new project will be
added to your workspace. Once the dependencies resolution
has been completed, we're ready to start playing with the
cluster.

====== Create the component

Now that we have the source code, we can create the component. From the OpenShift Application Explorer view,
right select the project (myproject), and the click the
 ```New -> Component``` menu:
 
image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer6.png[width=600]

Enter ```myservice``` in the ```Name``` field, click the ```Browse``` button to select the project we have just created, select ```java``` in the
 ```Component type``` field, select ```8``` in the ```Component version``` field,
enter ```myapp``` in the ```Application``` field and uncheck the
 ```Push after create``` check-box:
 
image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer7.png[width=600]

Then click the ```Finish``` button. The component will be created and expanding
the project node will now show the application that contains our component:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer8.png[width=600]

Expanding the application will now display our component:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer9.png[width=600]

The component has been created but it is not yet deployed on the cluster (as we
unchecked the ```Push after create``` check-box. In order to deploy it,right
select the component and click the ```Push``` menu. The deployment will be
created and then a build will be launched. A new window will be created in the
 ```Console``` view. After a while, you should see the following output:
 
image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer10.png[width=600]

The component is now deployed to the cluster but we cannot access it as we need
to define an URL to access it externally. Right select the component and click
the ```New -> URL``` menu:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer11.png[width=600]

Enter ```url1``` in the ```Name``` field and select ```8080``` in the ```Port```
field:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer12.png[width=600]

Then click on the ```Finish``` button. The URL is created but not on the cluster,
so we need to push again the component so that the local configuration is
synchronized with the configuration on the cluster. The ```Console``` window
will display a message claiming that a push is now required:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer13.png[width=600]

So push the component again (```component -> Push```).

Let's check that we can now access the service. Expand the component level so
that we can see the URL we have just created:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer14.png[width=600]

Right select the URL and click the ```Open in Browser``` menu, you should see the new browser window:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer15.png[width=600]

You can test the service: enter ```demo``` in the text box and click the
 ```Invoke``` button:
 
image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer16.png[width=600]

====== Feedback loop

We will now see how we can get fast feedback on code changes. So let's modify the
application code and see how we can synchronize the changes to the cluster.

In the ```Project Explorer``` view, locate the ```HttpApplication.java``` file:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer17.png[width=600]

Double click on the file to open the editor:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer18.png[width=600]

On line 14, change the line:

```java
  protected static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
```

to

```java
  protected static final String template = "Hello, %s!, we modified the code";
```
and press the ```Ctrl+S``` key in order to save the file.

For the OpenShift Application Explorer, right click the component (myservice) and
click the ```Push``` menu to send the changes to the cluster: the component will be
built again on the cluster with the next changes and after a few seconds, it will be
available again:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer19.png[width=600]

Select the browser window again, enter ```demo1``` in the textbox (we need to change
the value we used before in order to make sure cache is not involved) and click the
 ```Invoke``` button again:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer20.png[width=600]

We've seen that, through a sequence of code modification(s) followed by a synchronize
action (push) to the cluster, we can get a very fast feedback. If you don't want to
manually synchronize the the cluster (push), you can opt to automatically synchronize
to the cluster with the ```Watch``` action: each time a code modification is done locally
on your workstation, a new build will be automatically launched on the cluster.

====== Going further: debug your application on the cluster

Testing an application through code changes is a great achievement so far but it
may be difficult for complex applications where we need to understand how the code behaves
without the need to use the UI. That's why the next step is to be able to debug our application live on the cluster.

The new OpenShift Application Explorer allow such a scenario. We will first set up a breakpoint
in our application code. Select again the ```HttpApplication.java``` file and scroll
down to the ```greeting``` method:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer21.png[width=600]

On line 41, double click in the left ruler column so that a breakpoint is set:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer22.png[width=600]

We are now ready to debug our application. In order to do that, we need to launch
a local (Java in our case) debugger that will be connected to our application on the
cluster. This is what the ```Debug``` action is doing: right select the component
(myservice) and click the ```Debug``` menu: you will see that port forwarding has been
started so that our local (Java) debugger can connect to the remote Java virtual
machine:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer23.png[width=600]

and then a local (Java) debugger is launched and connected to that port. Let's check now that we can debug our application:

Select the browser window again, enter ```demo2``` in the textbox (we need to change
the value we used before in order to make sure cache is not involved) and click the
 ```Invoke``` button again: as our breakpoint is hit, you will be asked if you want to
switch to the ```Debug``` perspective (this may not be displayed if you previously
selected the ```Remember my decision``` checkbox:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer24.png[width=600]

Click the ```Switch``` button and you will see the ```Debug``` perspective:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/application-explorer25.png[width=600]

You are now debugging a Java component running on a remote cluster just like it was
running locally on your workstation. Please note that we demoed this feature using
a Java based component but we also support the same feature to NodeJS based components.


=== Quarkus

Starting with this release, we've added a new Quarkus tooling for applications built
on top of the Supersonic Subatomic Java https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] framework.

==== Quarkus project creation wizard

A new wizard has been added to create a new Quarkus application project in your workspace.
In order to launch it, first enter Ctrl+N to get the list of available wizards

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus1.png[]

In the filter text box, enter the ```qu``` characters to filter the list of wizards:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus2.png[]

Select the *Quarkus Project* wizard and click the *Next* button:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus3.png[]

The *Project type* combo allows you to choose between Maven or Gradle tool used to
manage your project. We'll go with Maven for this tutorial.

Enter a project name (we will use code-with-quarkus) and click the *Next* button:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus4.png[]

This dialog allows you to choose various parameters for you project, like the project
coordinates (group id, artifact id and version) along with the base REST endpoint information.
We'll use the default so click on the *Next* button:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus5.png[]

This dialog allows to select which Quarkus extensions you want to add to your project.
The extensions are grouped by categories, so first select a specific category in
the left table. We will choose the *Web* one:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus6-1.png[]

You should have noticed that the middle table has been updated. In order to add an extension,
double click on the extension in the middle table. We will add *RESTEasy JAX-RS* and
*RESTEasy Qute* (a templating engine):

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus7-1.png[]

You should have noticed that the extensions that you double clicked on are now being added
to the right table. If you want to remove an extension from the list of selected ones,
double click again either in the center table or in the right table.

We are now all set so click on the *Finish* button to launch the project creation.
The project creation job is then launched, dependencies are being retrieved and
after a while, the new project will appear in the *Project Explorer* window:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus8.png[]

We have successfully created our first Quarkus project. Let's see now how we can launch this application and debug it.

==== Running the Quarkus application

Running a Quarkus application can be done from the workbench Run configurations.
Select the *Run -> Run Configurations...* menu to display the dialog allowing to create a Run configuration.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus9.png[]

Scroll down until the *Quarkus Application* is visible and select it:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus10-1.png[]

Click on the *New configuration* button (top left):

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus11-1.png[]

A workspace project needs to be associated with the configuration so click on the *Browse*
button to see the project selection dialog:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus12-1.png[]

As the workspace contains a single project, it is automatically selected and we can click
on the *OK* button:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus13-1.png[]

The configuration is not ready to be used. So let's start our Quarkus application by clicking
on the *Run* button:

You should see a new Console being displayed.

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus14.png[]

The application is being built and after a while, it will be started:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus15.png[]

==== Debugging the Quarkus application

Debugging a Quarkus application is just a simple as launching the previous configuration
we've just created in Debug.
You just need to open the **Run -> Debug Configurations...**. menu and click on the *Debug* button.

It will start the Quarkus application like in the previous paragraph but also connect
a remote JVM debug configuration to your running Quarkus application. So if you have set breakpoints
in your application source files, the execution will automatically stops there.

==== application.properties content assist

Every Quarkus application is configured through a configuration called
**application.properties**.

The content of this configuration file is dependent of the set of Quarkus
extensions that your application is using. Some settings are mandatory, some others
are not and the possible values are specific to the nature of the setting:
boolean, integer, limited set of values (enumerations).

So, as a developer, you need to look at various guides and documentations
(the core Quarkus and the extension specific ones)

So Quarkus Tools provides content assist on those specific files that:

- validates the content of the application.properties files
- provides you with the possible setting names and values

Let's see it in action.

Go to *src/main/resources/application.properties* in the project and right click and select **Open With -> Generic Text Editor**:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus16.png[]

Go the third line of the file and invoke code completion (Ctrl + Space):

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus17.png[]

For each setting, a documentation is displayed when you mouse over the setting.
Let try to add **quarkus.http.port** to the file and mouse over this name:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus18.png[]

If we enter a wrong value (false instead of a numeric value), then the error will be highlighted:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus19.png[]

This is the first set of features that will be integration into the next version
of JBoss Tools. We encourage you to used it and if you are missing features and/or enhancements, don't hesitate to report them here: https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20JBIDE%20AND%20component%20%3D%20quarkus%20and%20status%20!%3D%20Closed%20and%20status%20!%3D%20Resolved%20[JBoss Tools issue tracker]


=== Hibernate Tools

==== Hibernate Runtime Provider Updates

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

===== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.12.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.12.Final.

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.15.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.15.Final.

=== Deprecation

The Forge, Java Server Tools (JST) and Visual Page Editor (VPE) have been deprecated.
Even though they received an update with this release, we have no plan to maintain or
add new features and they may be removed in the future.

In addition, the adapters for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Server 4.3 and 5.0
have also been deprecated.

=== Platform

==== Views, Dialogs and Toolbar

===== New view menu icon

The view menu chevron icon (▽) is replaced by a modern equivalent, the vertical ellipsis ( ⠇).

Almost every view has a menu that may contain additional configuration settings
like filters, layout settings, and so on. The view menu was often overlooked and
we expect that this change will help users to find it. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/view_menu.png[]

===== Find Actions: The improved Quick Access

The formerly called *Quick Access* action has been retitled to *Find Actions*
to better emphasize its goal.

The related UI has changed a bit to improve its usage and accessibility:

- The widget item is now a regular toolbar item (button-like)
- An icon is shown
- Right-clicking on the tool item works and shows typical actions, including *Hide*
- The proposals are now a regular dialog, centered on the workbench

These changes will greatly improve the experience if you're using a screen reader
as it relies on a more standardized focus state. This also leverages all the default
and usual accessibility features of dialogs (moveable, resizable...).

Loading the proposals has been improved as well to avoid UI freezes when loading proposals.

===== Find Actions finds text in file contents

*Find Actions* is now extended by the *Quick Text Search* feature to show the potential text
matches in file contents also in the proposals.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/file-content-find-action.png[]

If the Quick Text Search bundle wasn't started yet, you may miss those matches. In this case,
you can use *Find Actions* itself to activate the Quick Text Search by finding and selecting
the *Activate bundle for 'File content'* proposals entry.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/activate-file-content.png[]

===== Find Actions lists workspace files

*Find Actions* can now list matching file names from the workspace (similar to the
*Open Resource* dialog). Upon selection the file is opened in the editor.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/find-actions-resources.png[]

===== Inline rename for simple resources while in Project Explorer. 

In the *Project Explorer*, renaming (with the ```F2``` shortcut or Rename context menu)
will start an inline rename for normal resources when other files aren't affected by
the rename.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/project-explorer-inline-renaming.png[]

In cases where other files are affected by the rename, or the rename operation
is customized, the rename dialog will appear as it previously did.

==== Text Editors 

===== Show problem markers inline

You can now see the *errors, warnings, and info markers* inline in most of the
text editors. No more mousing around to see the actual error message!

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/annotation-code-mining-jdt.png[]

You can see the available quick fixes by clicking on the message.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/annotation-code-mining-quickfix.png[]

You can enable it on the *General > Editors > Text Editors* preference page and set
*Show Code Minings for Annotations* to:

- None (default)
- Errors only
- Errors and Warnings
- Errors, Warnings and Info
 
===== Backspace/delete can treat spaces as tabs

If you use the *Insert spaces for tabs* option, now you can also change the
backspace and delete keys behavior to remove multiple spaces at once, as if
they were a tab.

The new setting is called *Remove multiple spaces on backspace/delete* and is
found on the *General > Editors > Text Editors* preference page.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/delete-spaces-as-tabs.png[]
         
==== Debug

===== Collapse All Button in the Debug View

In the *Debug* View, now you can now use the new *Collapse All* button to collapse
all the launches.

Before collapsing: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/collapse-all-debug-view-before.png[]

After collapsing:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/collapse-all-debug-view-after.png[]

===== Control character interpretation in Console View

The *Console* View can now interpret the control characters backslash (```\b```)
and carriage return (```\r```).

This feature is disabled by default. You can enable it on the *Run/Debug > Console*
preference page.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/animated-progress-in-console.gif[]

==== Themes and Styling 

===== Improvements in UI Forms Styling

CSS customization of ```ExpandableComposite``` and ```Section``` was reworked to
give you more control over their styling. In dark mode, those elements now
integrate better with other Form elements.

Old:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/pom_dark_old.png[]

New:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/pom_dark_new.png[]

===== Perspective switcher gets aligned with normal toolbar styling

The special styling of the *Perspective switcher* has been removed to make the
Toolbar look consistent. This also reduces OS specific styling issues with the
perspective switcher.     

Old:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/old-perspective-switcher.png[]

New:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/new-perspective-switcher.png[]

===== Usage of consistent colors for the dark theme

The usage of different shades of gray in the dark theme was reduced.

The styling of the widgets is also not based on the selected view anymore, which
makes the UI more consistent.

==== General Updates

===== Ant 1.10.7

Eclipse has adopted Ant version 1.10.7.

===== Support for the Ant include task added

The Ant ```include``` task (available in the Ant library since 1.8.0) is now
fully recognized by the ant-ui-plugin and validated accordingly.

 
=== Java Developement Tools (JDT)

==== Java 13 Support

===== Java 13

Java™ 13 is available and Eclipse JDT supports Java 13 for the Eclipse 4.14 release. 

The release notably includes the following Java 13 features:

- JEP 354: Switch Expressions (Preview).
- JEP 355: Text Blocks (Preview).

Please note that these are preview language feature and hence enable preview option
should be on. For an informal introduction of the support, please refer to
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Java13/Examples[Java 13 Examples wiki].

===== Keyboard shortcut for Text Block creation

A keyboard shortcut *Ctrl + Shift + '* is added in the Java Editor for *text
blocks*, which is a preview feature added in Java 13.

Conditions under which this keyboard shortcut works are:

- The Java Project should have a compliance of 13 or above and the preview features should be enabled.
- The selection in the editor should not be part of a string or a comment or a text block.

Examples: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/textblock-pre-creation1.png[]

Pressing the shortcut gives:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/textblock-post-creation1.png[]

You can also encompass a selected text in text block as below:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/textblock-pre-creation2.png[]

On pressing the shortcut, you get this:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/textblock-post-creation2.png[]


==== Java Editor

===== Remove unnecessary array creation

A new cleanup action *Remove unnecessary array creation* has been added. It will
remove explicit array creation for ```varargs``` parameters.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/unnecessary-array-creation-option.png[]

For the given code: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/unnecessary-array-creation-before.png[]

After cleanup, you get this:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/unnecessary-array-creation-after.png[]

===== Push negation down in expression

A new Java cleanup/save action *Push down negation* has been added. It reduces
the double negation by reverting the arithmetic expressions.

For instance:

`!!isValid;` becomes `isValid;`

`!(a != b);` becomes `(a == b);`

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/push-down-negation.png[]

===== Provide templates for empty Java source files

When dealing with empty Java source files, some basic templates (class, interface, enum)
will now be available from the content assist popup.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/templates-empty-java-file.png[]

===== Postfix completion proposal category

Postfix completion allows certain kinds of language constructs to be applied to
the previously entered text.

For example: Entering ```"input text".var``` and selecting the
*var - Creates a new variable* proposal, will result in ```String name = "input text"```.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/postfix-completion.png[]

===== try-with-resources quickfix

A quickfix has been added to create a ```try-with-resources``` statement based on
the selected lines. Lines that are selected must start with declarations of objects
that implement ```AutoCloseable```. These declarations are added as the resources
of the ```try-with-resources``` statement.

If there are selected statements that are not eligible resources (such as Objects
that don't implement ```AutoCloseable```), then the first such statement and all
the following selected statements will be placed in the ```try-with-resources```
body.

Method before applying try-with-resources: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/tryWithResource1.png[]

Select all the lines inside the method, then use the short-cut *Ctrl+1* and click
on *Surround with try-with-resources* from the list:
 
image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/tryWithResource2.png[]

This results in: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/tryWithResource3.png[]

===== Javadoc tag checking for modules

Support has been added to check the Javadoc of a module-info.java file to report
missing and duplicate ```@uses``` and ```@provides``` tags depending on the
compiler settings (*Preferences > Java > Compiler > Javadoc*).

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/checkModuleJavadoc.png[]


==== Java Formatter

===== Formatting of text blocks

The code formatter can now handle *text blocks*, which is a preview feature added
in Java 13. It's controlled by the *Text block indentation* setting, found right
in the *Indentation* section of the *Profile Editor (Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Edit...*).

By default, text block lines are indented the same way as wrapped code lines,
that is with two extra tabs relative to the starting indentation (or whatever is
set as *Default indentation for wrapped lines* in the *Line Wrapping* section).
You can also set it to use only one tab for indentation (*Indent by one*), align
all lines to the position of the opening quotes (*Indent on column*), or preserve
the original formatting (*Do not touch*).

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.14/images/formatter-text-block.png[]

===== Blank lines between Javadoc tags

The code formatter can now divide Javadoc tags into groups (by type, for example
 ```@param```, ```@throws```, ```@returns```) and separate these groups with blank
lines. This feature can be turned on in the *Comments > Javadocs* section by
checking the *Blank lines between tags of different type* box. 
 
===== Space after not operator

A new setting has been added to control whether a space should be added *after not
(```!```) operator*, independently from other unary operators. To find it, expand
sections *Whitespace > Expressions > Unary* operators and go to the last checkbox.

==== JUnit

===== BREE update for org.eclipse.jdt.junit.runtime

The Bundle Required Execution Environment (BREE) for the
 ```org.eclipse.jdt.junit.runtime``` bundle is now J2SE-1.5.

==== Debug

===== No suspending on exception recurrence

A new workspace preference has been added for exception breakpoints: *Suspend
policy for recurring exception instances* controls whether the same exception
instance may cause the debugger to suspend more than once.

This option is relevant when debugging an application that has ```try``` blocks at
several levels of the architecture. In this situation an exception breakpoint
may fire multiple times for the same actual exception instance: A ```throw```
statement inside a ```catch``` block may re-throw the same exception. The same
holds for each ```finally``` block or ```try-with-resources``` block.

When the debugger stops due to an exception breakpoint, you may want to continue
your debug session by pressing *Resume (F8)*, but all that catching and re-throwing
will force you to observe all locations where the same exception will surface again
and again. Suspending at all ```try``` blocks on the call stack may also spoil your
context of open Java editors, by opening more editors of classes that are likely
irrelevant for the debugging task at hand.

The *JDT Debugger* will now detect this situation, and the first time it notices the
same exception instance recurring at the surface, a new question dialog is shown:

If you select *Skip* in this dialog, the current exception instance will be dismissed for good.
Still, new instances of the same exception type will cause suspending when they are thrown.

If you check *Remember my decision* your choice will be stored in the mentioned workspace
preference to be effective for all exception breakpoints.

Even after choosing *Skip* — resp. *Only once* in the preferences — you can have the old
behavior simply by pressing *Step Return (F7)* instead of *Resume*.

==== JDT Developers

===== Flag whether content assist extension needs to run in UI thread

The existing ```org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javaCompletionProposalComputer```,
 ```org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javadocCompletionProposalComputer``` and
 ```org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javaCompletionProposalSorters``` extension points now allow
a new attribute *requiresUIThread* that allows a developer to declare whether running
in the UI thread is required or not.

This information will be used by the *Content Assist* operation to allow some
optimizations and prevent UI freezes by reducing the amount of work happening
in the UI thread.

To preserve backward compatibility, the default value for this attribute (if unset)
is ```true```, meaning the extension is expected to run in the UI thread.

You can find more noteworthy updates in on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.14.0.Final.html[this page].

== What is next?

Having JBoss Tools 4.14.0 and Red Hat CodeReady Studio 12.14 out we are already working on the next release for Eclipse 2020-03.

Enjoy!
