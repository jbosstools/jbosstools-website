JBoss Tools Integration Stack 4.1.7.Final / JBoss Developer Studio Integration Stack 7.1.0.GA

The Integration Stack for JBoss Tools Developer Studio is a set of plugins for Eclipse that provides integration tooling for the following frameworks.

== JBoss Business Process and Rules Development

== JBoss Data Virtualization Development

* link:/features/modeshape.html[Modeshape] - A distributed, hierarchical, transactional and consistent data store with support for queries, full-text search, events, versioning, references, and flexible and dynamic schemas. It is very fast, highly available, extremely scalable, and it is 100% open source.
