== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar codereadystudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.19 (2021-03) but we recommend
using the latest https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2021-03/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-and-web-developers[Eclipse 4.19 2021-03 JEE Bundle]

since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

[WARNING]
====
Java11 is now required to run Red Hat Developer Studio or JBoss Tools (this is a requirement from Eclipse 4.17). So make sure to select a Java11 JDK in the installer.
You can still work with pre-Java11 JDK/JRE and projects in the tool.
====

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was an improved tooling for the Quarkus framework, improvements for container based development and bug fixing.

=== OpenShift

==== Improved OpenShift Application explorer

When the OpenShift cluster has no applications or projects, user is required to create them. However,
it may not be obvious for the user that the corresponding function is available from a sub menu of the
New context menu.

So now, a link will be provided within the tree with an explanation message.

If no projects are available, user will be guided to create one:

If no applications are available in a project, user will be guided to create a new component:

=== Server Tools

==== Wildfly 24 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 24.

==== EAP 7.4 Beta Server Adapter

The server adapter has been adapted to work with EAP 7.4 Beta.

=== Hibernate Tools

==== Hibernate Runtime Provider Updates

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

===== New Runtime Provider

The new Hibernate 5.5 runtime provider has been added. It incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.5.3.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.5.3.Final

===== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.32.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.32.Final.



=== And more...

You can find more noteworthy updates in on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.19.1.Final.html[this page].
