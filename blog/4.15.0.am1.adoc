Happy to announce 4.15.0.AM1 (Developer Milestone 1) build for Eclipse 2020-03.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/2020-03/4.15.0.AM1.html[JBoss Tools 4.15.0 AM1].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.15.0.AM1.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

Please note that a regression has been found in the Fuse Tools. This is going
to be fixed for the release (4.15.0.Final). Please find more information in this
https://issues.redhat.com/browse/FUSETOOLS-3333[ticket].

=== Quarkus Tools

==== Language support for Kubernetes, Openshift, S2i and Docker properties

There is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for kubernetes.*,
openshift.*, s2i.*, docker.* properties

==== Language support for MicroProfile REST Client properties

Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the
MicroProfile properties from REST Client.

After registering a REST client using `@RegisterRestClient` like so:
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient
public interface MyServiceClient {
	@GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----

The related MicroProfile Rest config properties will have language feature support
(completion, hover, validation, etc.).

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus24.png[]

Change the Java code so that the configuration key is changed:
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "myclient")
public interface MyServiceClient {
	@GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----

and notice the code assist is changed accordingly:

==== Language support for MicroProfile Health

Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the
MicroProfile Health artifacts.

So if you have the following Health class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Health;

@Health
public class MyHealth {

}
----

you will get a validation error (as the class does not implement the `HealthCheck`
interface:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus26.png[]

Similarly, if you have a class that implements `HealthCheck` but is not annotated with `Health`, some workflow applies:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

public class MyHealth implements HealthCheck {

	@Override
	public HealthCheckResponse call() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return null;
	}

}
----

you will get a validation error (as the class is not annotated with `Health`
interface:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus27.png[]

As there are several ways to fix the problem, then several quick fixes are proposed.

=== Server Tools

==== Wildfly 19 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 19. It adds support for
Java EE 8, Jakarta EE 8 and Microprofile 3.3.

Please note that while creating a Wildfly 19 server adapter, you may get a warning.
This is going to be fixed for the release.

==== EAP 7.3 Server Adapter

The server adapter has been adapted to work with EAP 7.3.



Enjoy!
