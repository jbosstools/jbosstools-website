Happy to announce 4.6.0.AM3 (Developer Milestone 3) build for Eclipse Photon.0.RC3.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/photon/4.6.0.AM3.html[JBoss Tools 4.6.0 AM3].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.6.0.AM3.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== General

==== Eclipse Photon

JBoss Tools is now targeting Eclipse Photon RC3.

=== Fuse Tooling

== Camel URI completion with XML DSL

As announced link:https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/01/31/apache-camel-uri-completion-eclipse-xml-editor/[here], it was already possible to have Camel URI completion with XML DSL in the source tab of the Camel Route editor by installing the link:https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-eclipse[Language Support for Apache Camel] in your IDE.

This feature is now installed by default with Fuse Tooling!

Now you have the choice to use the properties view with UI help to configure Camel components or to use the source editor and benefit from completion features. It all depends on your development preferences!

=== Webservices Tooling

==== JAX-RS 2.1 Support

JAX-RS 2.1 is part of JavaEE8 and JBoss Tools now provides you with support for this update of the specification. 

===== Server side events

JAX-RS 2.1 brought support for server side events. The `Sse` and `SseEventSink` resources can now be injected into 
method arguments thanks to the @Context annotation.


Enjoy!
