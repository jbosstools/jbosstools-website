Happy to announce 4.4.2.AM3 (Developer Milestone 3) build for Eclipse Neon.1, the latest milestone before the GA release.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/neon/4.4.2.AM3.html[JBoss Tools 4.4.2 AM3].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.4.2.AM3.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== OpenShift 3

An important new feature made it into this milestone: the NodeJS application support on OpenShift.

==== Node.js Debugger 

Now it is possible to debug Node.js applications deployed to Openshift. All you need to do is creating a *Server Adapter* for the app and running it in the *Debug* mode. After that a new *V8* debug session will be created:

Put some breakpoints in the code and start debugging!

Changing the code during the debug session is also supported - just save the file and new changes will be applied automatically. Here is a short demo video which describes the debugging process in action:
