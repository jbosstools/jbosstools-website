With the release of link:/downloads/devstudio/neon/10.2.0.GA.html[Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 10.2], it is now possible to install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio as an RPM.
It is available as a tech preview. The purpose of this article is to describe the steps you should follow in order to install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio.
 
== Red Hat Software Collections

JBoss Developer Studio RPM relies on Red Hat Software Collections. You don't need to install Red Hat Software Collections but you need to enable
the Red Hat Software Collections repositories before you start the installation of the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio.

=== Enabling the Red Hat Software Collections base repository

The identifier for the repository is *rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms* on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server and *rhel-workstation-rhscl-7-rpms* on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation.

The command to enable the repository on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server is:

```
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
```

The command to enable the repository on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation is:

```
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-workstation-rhscl-7-rpms
```

=== Enabling the Red Hat Software Collections Extended Update Support repository

The identifier for the repository is *rhel-server-rhscl-7-eus-rpms*.

The command to enable the repository is:

```
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
```

For more information, please refer to the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-software-collections/?version=2/[Red Hat Software Collections] documentation.

== JBoss Developer Studio repository

As this is a tech preview, you need to manually configure the JBoss Developer Studio repository. 

Create a file */etc/yum.repos.d/rh-eclipse46-devstudio.repo* with the following content:

```
[rh-eclipse46-devstudio-stable-10.x]
name=rh-eclipse46-devstudio-stable-10.x
baseurl=https://devstudio.redhat.com/static/10.0/stable/rpms/x86_64/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
upgrade_requirements_on_install=1
metadata_expire=24h
```

== Red Hat developer signing key

As this is tech preview, you need to access the Red Hat developer signing key that has been used for producing the JBoss Developer Studio RPM.

Execute the following command:

```
sudo rpm --import "https://www.redhat.com/security/a5787476.txt"
```

== Install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

You're now ready to install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio through RPM.

Enter the following command:

```
sudo yum install rh-eclipse46-devstudio
```

Answer 'y' when asked and after all required dependencies have been downloaded and installed, Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is available on your 
system through the standard update channel !!!
