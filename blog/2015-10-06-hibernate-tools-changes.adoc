= A Focus on Hibernate Changes

Over the past two years we have been working hard to rationalize and improve 
the support for different Hibernate versions in the JBoss Tools suite. This 
effort has resulted in real multiversion support but some of the changes may
have an impact on the way how you tackle your Hibernate projects in JBoss Tools.
Read on if you are a user of Hibernate reverse engineering tooling and of the
Hibernate console configuration.

== Why Did We Need These Changes in the First Place?

Already for a long time there was support for multiple Hibernate versions in 
JBoss Tools. When creating a console configuration for instance, it was possible 
to select the desired version using a dropdown box.

After choosing the appropriate version for a console configuration, and using
this console configuration for the reverse engineering of entity classes from 
the database, one can see below that effectively the selected version of Hibernate 
was used for the generation (in this case 4.0).

OK, so far so good. But when we needed to provide support for JPA 2.1 
we stumbled across a major problem. We added the Hibernate 4.3 runtime 
which contains JPA 2.1 support and all seemed to be going well. Unfortunately we found that expanding the 
created console configuration for JPA 2.1 projects resulted in the error message below.

Investigation of this problem showed that there was a mixup of Hibernate classes due
to a mistake in the dependency graph between the different Eclipse plugins that contained
the respective Hibernate runtime contributions. At this point the dependencies looked 
like the schema below.

It turned out that, no matter what Hibernate version you chose for the console configuration,
expanding the configuration in the Eclipse view was always using the Hibernate 3.5 classes
exposed by the *org.hibernate.eclipse.libs* plugin. To summarize, some of the functionality 
of the Hibernate tooling in Eclipse was using the chosen version properly while the rest of the 
functionality was always using version 3.5.

== OK This Looks Messy Indeed, How Did We Solve It?

So the problem with the schema above is the direct dependency of the *org.hibernate.eclipse*
plugin (as well as some other of the Hibernate tools Eclipse plugins) on *org.hibernate.eclipse.libs*. 
This last plugin contains the Hibernate 3.5 runtime as well as some other related libraries and it
effectively hides the Hibernate runtime classes that are contributed by the different 
*org.jboss.tools.hibernateX_Y* plugins. 

The correct solution for this problem was, as is
fairly classical in software engineering, to introduce an additional layer of indirection.

As you can see above a new *org.jboss.tools.hibernate.runtime.spi* plugin was created. In the
Hibernate tools Eclipse plugins only classes and interfaces from this SPI plugin are used while all the 
immediate uses on core Hibernate classes were removed. A number of runtime provider plugins then
implement these SPI interfaces and contribute their functionality by means of the Eclipse 
extension point mechanism. Also the *org.hibernate.eclipse.libs* plugin was removed.

As an additional step and to eliminate a lot of duplicated code in the different runtime 
plugins, we moved to a situation in which a lot of the code was moved to an abstract implementation
of the Hibernate runtime providers. All the concrete uses of the actual Hibernate classes 
remained in the Hibernate runtime provider classes.

== How Does All of This Affect Me, Avid Hibernate Tools User?

The most important change that can possibly effect you is the removal of the *org.hibernate.eclipse.libs* 
plugin. Not only did this plugin contain the classes of the core Hibernate 3.5 runtime but it also 
included some Hibernate related classes that are considered optional. Among these where cache implementations 
such as *Ehcache* and connection pool implementations such as *C3P0*. As caching and connection
pooling are not really relevant for the tooling and as there are way too many possible options 
for them to be all included in all of the Hibernate runtime providers, we decided to not include 
them anymore.

So if you include classes from these optional bundles in your Hibernate configuration file, you will 
probably bump against problems like link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-18299[this issue].

Assume like in this case that you want to use second level cache and use the Ehcache implementation. So you have 
written a Hibernate configuration file in which you have defined the session factory like as follows:

------------------------------------------
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.h2.Driver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:h2:test</property>
        <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect</property>
        
        <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property>
        <property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache">true</property>
        <property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">
            org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory
        </property>
        
        <mapping class="..."/>
		...
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
------------------------------------------

When you create a Hibernate console configuration in Eclipse using this definition, and you will try to 
expand it, this will result in an error like shown below. Evidently, because the *org.hibernate.eclipse.libs* 
plugin containing the *org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory* class was removed, a 
ClassNotFoundException will be the cause of this SessionFactory error.

This problem can be solved in two possible ways. The first way is to add the jar files containing the missing
classes to the project class path. As can be seen on the image below, the console configuration can now be 
expanded without an error.

One can argue that it is not a very clean solution to pollute the project class path with artifacts that are
not really needed just to make the tooling run properly. This is a valid point and it is
the reason why we have a second solution that is probably preferable.

In this case you can just edit the 
console configuration by using 'Edit Configuration' from the context menu. In the opened dialog, you can 
switch to the Classpath page and add the missing jar files. The image below illustrates this approach.

== Conclusion

Because of the architectural changes that we implemented for the Eclipse Hibernate tooling, real support for 
multiple versions of Hibernate is now available and working properly. 

The removal of the
*org.hibernate.eclipse.libs* plugin introduced the possibility of missing some classes when working with the
Hibernate console configuration in Eclipse. As we showed, this can be easily fixed by directly adding the 
libraries containing the missing classes on the class path of the console configuration.
