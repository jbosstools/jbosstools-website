Happy to announce 4.27.0.AM1 (Developer Milestone 1) build for Eclipse 2023-03M3.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/2023-03/4.27.0.AM1.html[JBoss Tools 4.27.0 AM1].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.27.0.AM1.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== General

==== Components Depreciation

As previously announced https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-28678[here], we're in the process to remove the Central / update tab from JBossTools in next release. This work can be followed https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-28852[here]. 

That means that all the current extra features that can be installed via this tab needs to be available through a new channel. This channel already exists as p2 repo, but using https://www.eclipse.org/mpc/[Eclipse Marketplace Client] is more close to what's existing right now. 

Most of those additional features are already present in the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-tools[Jboss marketplace entry], so it's just a matter of use it to install your favorite feature.

=== OpenShift

==== OpenShift Application Explorer view service creation support

The missing create service feature is now back in this release.

==== OpenShift Application Explorer view service binding support
