Happy to announce 4.11.0.AM1 (Developer Milestone 1) build for Eclipse 2018-12.

Downloads available at link:/downloads/jbosstools/2018-12/4.11.0.AM1.html[JBoss Tools 4.11.0 AM1].

== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.11.0.AM1.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.

=== Server Tools

==== EAP 7.2 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with EAP 7.2.

=== OpenShift 3

==== New OpenShift connection helper

When you need to defined a new OpenShift connection, you need to provide the following information:

- cluster URL
- username and password or token

If you've already logged in your cluster through the OpenShift Web Console, you can copy an `oc` command
in the clipboard that contains both the cluster URL and your token. 

So, from now, there is a new option that allows you to initialize the wizard fields from the copied `oc`
command:

Click on the `Paste Login Command` button and the fields will be initialized:

Enjoy!
