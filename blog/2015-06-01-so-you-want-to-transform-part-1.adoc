= You want to transform data with Fuse ? - Part 1

We've been working hard on improving our tooling story for Fuse for a
few months. One of the areas we've been focusing on specifically has
been Transformation tooling. It's been missing in the JBoss Tools suite
for a while now and something we needed to address.

As a result, we ended up with the Fuse Transformation tooling, which
I'll be talking about over the course of a few blog posts.

== First, What Exactly _Is_ the Fuse Transformation Tooling?

The last transformation tooling we had in JBoss Tools leveraged Smooks
to convert one format to another. This time we're using the link:https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer[Dozer]
framework, which offers a great base for handling Java to Java
transformations. Through various APIs, you can convert just about
anything to a Java model these days and that gives us a good place to
start.

With the addition of link:http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/[Fuse] technologies (and some awesome developers), we
gained some cool new toys in the tooling and a big part of that is the
Camel Editor (i.e. the "Fuse Tooling Routes Editor"). The Fuse
Transformation tooling builds on that and offers:

. the Fuse Transformation Editor, which offers visual editing of a Dozer
configuration file

. the New Fuse Transformation wizard, which creates a new Transformation
file and integrates it as an endpoint in a Camel configuration

. and the New Fuse Transformation Test wizard, which creates the outline
for a new JUnit test you can run to test your transformation

Though we're in Tech Preview for now, we have good collection of
functionality already and we'll walk through some of that.

== Where Can We Get These Toys?

The new tooling appears in the JBoss Tools Integration Stack "Early
Access" site, so be sure to keep up with that effort. (You can see
Paul's latest post here: link:http://tools.jboss.org/blog/2015-04-16-JBTIS-421-Final.html[
"JBoss Tools Integration Stack - Luna integration tooling for BRMS/BPMS, 
Data Virt, SOA 5.x + Early Access Fuse and SwitchYard."]

Keep up to date with JBoss Tools Integration Stack to ensure you have the 
latest version of the Transformation tooling.

== Let's Start With a Use Case - XML to JSON

I'm going to cheat a little and start with the link:https://github.com/fusesource/fuseide/tree/master/examples/transformation/starter["Starter"] project that we
have created for the Transformation project. It includes some sample
data to demonstrate transforming from XML to JSON. It includes a sample
Camel configuration as well (in either Spring or Blueprint form) that
provides a route that takes a file and routes it to another. In this
case, we're going from a sales order in XML format (link:https://github.com/fusesource/fuseide/blob/master/examples/transformation/starter/src/main/resources/abc-order.xsd[abc-order.xml]) to a
sales order in JSON format (link:https://github.com/fusesource/fuseide/blob/master/examples/transformation/starter/src/main/resources/xyz-order-schema.json[xyz-order-schema.json]). This is a common
integration case where you have to migrate one format to another.

== But Wait! Didn't You Say Dozer Is Strictly Java-to-Java?

Why yes, I did! But I also said that we have ways to create Java models
from other formats. And in this first wave of Transformation
functionality we offer built-in conversion from XML (XML schemas or
instance documents) and JSON (JSON schemas or instance documents) to
help get you that far. plus some other, more open-ended capabilities we'll talk about down the line, 
we will walk through each step of getting you
from your sample data to a fully testable solution.

So let's get started...

== Launching the Wizard

There are three main ways to launch the New Transformation Wizard in
Eclipse...

1.  From the top-level menu in the Eclipse workbench, use
File->New->Other... (or Ctrl+N), then look for Fuse Tooling->Fuse
Transformation
2.  Right-click on a project in the Project Explorer, select
New->Other... then look for Fuse Tooling->Fuse Transformation
3.  Open a Camel file (Spring or Blueprint) and drag the
Transformation->Data Transformation item from the palette onto the
canvas (see below)

== New Fuse Transformation Wizard, Start Page

Once you've launched the New Fuse Transformation Wizard, you are
presented with a wizard page that looks something like the following.

1.  To start, depending on how you've launched the wizard, you may have
to select the Project explicitly. The drop-down list is populated by a
list of all projects that include Camel configurations (either Spring or
Blueprint).
2.  The Transformation ID becomes the explicit name of the Dozer
endpoint that gets created in the Camel route. We then can reference
that endpoint in the route itself. Since we're transforming an XML file
into a JSON file, we'll call ours "xml2json".
3.  The Dozer File Path calls out the location and name of the Dozer
configuration file. It is pre-populated with the name
"transformation.xml" and will place the file in the src/main/resource
folder of your project, but you can name it whatever you'd like and
provide a project-relative path so long as the path can be found in the
project classpath. We'll leave it at the default for now.
4.  The Camel File Path points to the Camel configuration file you are
adding this transformation to. In the case below, we have selected the
Spring Camel configuration in the starter project.

== New Fuse Transformation Wizard, Selecting Types to Transform

Currently with the wizard we have the ability to transform to and from
one of four different types:

* Java (Existing Java model)
* XML (XML Schema or Instance Document)
* JSON (JSON Schema or Instance Document)
* Other (Special case we'll cover in another post)

Today we're focused on converting from XML to JSON, so we'll select
those two types and click Next.

== New Fuse Transformation Wizard, Source XML Details

Since we selected XML as the Source Type on the Start page, we'll see
the "Source Type (XML)" page appear next. If we had selected another
type, we'd see that page here.

In this case, we have an XML Schema document (abc-order.xml) that we
want to transform from. So we'll click on the Source File field's "..."
button to browse for our file, select abc-order.xml, and click Next to
continue. If you have a particularly complex schema, you may need to
select from the root elements you wish to key on for the transformation.

== New Fuse Transformation Wizard, Target JSON Details

Since we selected JSON as the Target Type on the Start page, we'll see
the "Target Type (JSON)" page appear next. If we had selected another
type, we'd see that page here.

In this case, we have an JSON Schema document (xyz-order-schema.json)
that we want to transform to. So we'll click on the Target File field's
"..." button to browse for our file, select xyz-order-schema.json, and
click Finish to continue.

== Finishing Up...

As soon as the wizard is done, you'll notice two things.

. The Fuse Transformation Editor opens so you can edit your new Dozer
configuration file.

. The Camel Editor has been updated with the new Transformation endpoint
you just created. (Notice the "dirty" flag on the "camel-context.xml"
tab.)

For now, we'll close our new Transformation and go back to the Camel
route to finish hooking up the new endpoint.

== Going back to the Camel editor

When we select the Camel editor again, we notice that a new endpoint
reference has been added to the canvas. We need to now hook that into
our route so it happens between our source and target steps of this
simple configuration.

The first thing we need to do is delete the existing link between the
"src" and "target" elements of the route. You can click on it and hit
the Delete key on your keyboard or right-click on the arrow and select
"Remove." When it asks if you want to remove the element, click Yes.

== Wiring up our New Endpoint

Now we can wire up the endpoint.

. If you hover the mouse over the "src" file element, you'll see a
toolbar pop up. Click and drag the Arrow to our new endpoint.

. Do the same thing from the endpoint to the "target" element.

. Next, save the Camel editor and it will refresh the view to clean up
your route a little.

== End for today...

So now we have a new Transformation endpoint that is wired into our
Camel route.

Next time we'll start doing the actual editing of the Transformation
itself!
