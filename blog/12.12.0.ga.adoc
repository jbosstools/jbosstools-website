== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar codereadystudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.12 (2019-06) but we recommend
using the latest http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-06/r/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers[Eclipse 4.12 2019-06 JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
Eclipse 2019-06 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2019-06 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.

=== OpenShift

==== OpenShift Container Platform 4 support

With the new OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 now available (see this 
https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-redefines-enterprise-kubernetes-through-full-stack-automation-red-hat-openshift-4?source=pressreleaselisting[article,window=_blank]),
even if this is a major shift compared to OCP 3, JBoss Tools is compatible with
this major release in a transparent way. Just define your connection to your
OCP 4 based cluster as you did before for an OCP 3 cluster, and use the tooling !


=== Server tools

==== Wildfly 17 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with Wildfly 17. It adds support for Java EE 8. 

=== Hibernate Tools

==== New Runtime Provider

The new Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider has been added. It incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.3.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.3.Final

==== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.10.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.10.Final.


=== Maven

==== Maven support updated to M2E 1.12

The Maven support is based on Eclipse M2E 1.12

=== Platform

==== Views, Dialogs and Toolbar
 
===== Import project by passing it as command-line argument

You can import a project into Eclipse by passing its path as a parameter to the
launcher. The command would look like ```eclipse /path/to/project``` on Linux and Windows,
or ```open Eclipse.app -a /path/to/project``` on macOS.

===== Launch Run and Debug configurations from Quick Access

From the *Quick Access* proposals (accessible with ```Ctrl+3``` shortcut) you can now directly launch
any of the Run or Debug configurations available in your workspace. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/run-debug-quickaccess.png[]

NOTE: For performance reasons, the extra *Quick Access* entries are only visible if the ```org.eclipse.debug.ui```
bundle was already activated by some previous action in the workbench such as editing a launch configuration,
or expanding the _Run As..._ menus.

==== Themes and Styling 

===== Improved View Menu Icon

The icon used for the view menu has been improved. It is now crisp on high resolution
displays and also looks much better in the dark theme.

Compare the old version at the top and the new version at the bottom:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/view_menu.png[]

===== High resolution images drawn on Mac

On Mac, images and text are now drawn in high resolution during GC operations.
You can see crisp images on high resolution displays in the editor rulers, forms, etc in Eclipse.

Compare the old version at the top and the new version at the bottom:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/hidpi-mac-new-behavior.png[]

===== Table/Tree background lines shown in dark theme on Mac

In dark theme on Mac, the *Table* and *Trees* in Eclipse now show the alternating dark lines
in the background when ```setLinesVisible(true)``` is set. Earlier they had a gray background
even if line visibility was true. 

Example of a Tree and Table in Eclipse with alternating dark lines in the background: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/dark-theme-alternating-lines.png[]


==== Equinox

When the *Equinox OSGi Framework* is launched the installed bundles are activated according
to their configured start-level. The bundles with lower start-levels are activated first.
Bundles within the same start-level are activated sequentially from a single thread.

A new configuration option ```equinox.start.level.thread.count``` has been added that enables
the framework to start bundles within the same start-level in parallel. The default value is ```1```
which keeps the previous behavior of activating bundles from a single thread.
Setting the value to ```0``` enables parallel activation using a thread count equal
to ```Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()```. Setting the value to a number greater than ```1```
will use the specified number as the thread count for parallel bundle activation.

The default is ```1``` because of the risk of possible deadlock when activating bundles in parallel.
Extensive testing must be done on the set of bundle installed in the framework before considering
enabling this option in a product.

 
=== Java Developement Tools (JDT)

==== Java 12 Support

===== Change project compliance and JRE to 12

A quick fix *Change project compliance and JRE to 12* is provided to change the current project
to be compatible with Java 12. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-change-compliance-12.png[]

===== Enable preview features

Preview features in Java 12 can be enabled using *Preferences > Java > Compiler > Enable preview features*
option. The problem severity of these preview features can be configured using the
*Preview features with severity level* option.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/enable-preview.png[]

===== Set Enable preview features

A quick fix *Configure problem severity* is provided to update the problem severity of
preview features in Java 12.  

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-configure-severity-12.png[]

===== Add default case to switch statement

A quick fix *Add 'default' case* is provided to add default case to a enhanced switch statement in Java 12. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-default-switch-statement.png[]

===== Add missing case statements to switch statement

A quick fix *Add missing case statements* is provided for a enhanced switch statement in Java 12. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-missing-case-switch-statement.png[]

===== Add default case to switch expression

A quick fix *Add 'default' case* is provided to add default case to a switch expression.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-default-switch-expression.png[]

===== Add missing case statements to switch expression

A quick fix *Add missing case statements* is provided for switch expressions.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-missing-case-switch-expression.png[]

===== Format whitespaces in 'switch'

As Java 12 introduced some new features into the ```switch``` construct, the formatter profile
has some new settings for it. The settings allow you to control spaces around the arrow operator
(separately for ```case``` and ```default```) and around commas in a multi-value case.

The settings can be found in the *Profile Editor (Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Edit...)*
under the *White space > Control statements > 'switch'* subsection.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/formatter-switch.png[]

===== Split Switch Case Labels

As Java 12 introduced the ability to group multiple ```switch``` case labels into a single case expression,
a quick assist is provided that allows these grouped labels to be split into separate case statements.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/split-switch-case-labels.png[]


==== Java Editor 

===== Show method parameter names on code as code minings

In the *Java > Editor > Code Mining* preferences, you can now enable the *Show parameter names* option.
This will show the parameter names as code minings in method or constructor calls, for cases where
the resolution may not be obvious for a human reader.

For example, the code mining will be shown if the argument name in the method call is not an exact match
of the parameter name or if the argument name doesn't contain the parameter name as a substring.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/parameter-name-codeminings.png[]

===== Show number of implementations of methods as code minings

In the *Java > Editor > Code Mining* preferences, selecting
*Show implementations with the Show References (including implementations) for -> Methods* option now
shows implementations of methods.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/method-implementation-codeminings.png[]

Clicking on method implementations brings up the *Search* view that shows all implementations of the method in sub-types.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/method-implementation-codeminings-click.png[]

===== Open single implementation/reference in editor from code mining

When the *Java > Editor > Code Mining* preferences are enabled and a single implementation or reference is shown,
moving the cursor over the annotation and using *Ctrl+Click* will open the editor and display the single
implementation or reference.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/ctrlclickimpl.png[]

===== Additional quick fixes for service provider constructors

Appropriate quick fixes are offered when a service defined in a ```module-info.java``` file has a service provider
implementation whose no-arg constructor is not visible, or is non-existent.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/service-provider-create-constructor.png[]

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/service-provider-change-constructor-visibility.png[]

===== Template to create Switch Labeled Statement and Switch Expressions

The *Java Editor* now offers new templates for the creation of switch labeled statements and switch expressions.
On a switch statement, three new templates: *switch labeled statement*, *switch case expression* and
*switch labeled expression* are available as shown below. These new templates are available on Java projects
having compliance level of Java 12 or above.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/switch_labeled_statement.png[]

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/switch_case_expression.png[]

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/switch_labeled_expression.png[]

If *switch* is being used as an expression, then only *switch case expression*
and *switch labeled expression* templates are available as shown below:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/switch_expression_templates.png[]

==== Java Views and Dialogs

===== Enable comment generation in modules and packages

An option is now available to enable/disable the comment generation while
creating ```module-info.java``` or ```package-info.java```.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/module-info-comment-generation-check-box.png[]

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/package-info-comment-generation-checkbox.png[]

===== Improved 'create getter and setter' quick assist

The quick assist for creating getter and setter methods from fields no longer forces you to create both.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/getter-setter-dialog-new.png[]

===== Quick fix to open all required closed projects

A quick fix to open all required closed projects is now available in the *Problems* view.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-open-missing-projects-problem-view.png[]

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/quickfix-open-missing-projects.png[]

===== New UI for configuring Module Dependencies

The *Java Build Path* configuration now has a new tab *Module Dependencies*, which will gradually replace
the options previously hidden behind the *Is Modular* node on other tabs of this dialog. The new tab provides
an intuitive way for configuring all those module-related options for which Java 9 had introduced new command
line options like ```--limit-modules``` etc.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/module-dependencies-cropped.png[]

The dialog focuses on how to build one Java Project, here "org.greetings".

Below this focus module, the left hand pane shows all modules that participate in the build, where decorations
A and S mark automatic modules and system modules, respectively. The extent of system modules (from JRE)
can be modified with the *Add System Module...* and *Remove* buttons (corresponds to ```--add-modules```
and ```--limit-modules```).

When a module is selected in the left hand pane, the right hand pane allows to configure the following properties
for this module:

*Read Module:*

Select additional modules that should be accessible from the selected module (corresponds to ```--add-reads```)

*Expose Package:*

Select additional packages to be exposed ("exports" or "opens") from the selected module (corresponds
to ```--add-exports``` or ```--add-opens```)

*Patch with:*

Add more packages and classes to the selected module (corresponds to ```--patch-module```)
         
==== Java Compiler 

===== Experimental Java index retired

Eclipse 4.7 introduced a new experimental Java index which was disabled by default.

Due to lack of resources to properly support all Java 9+ language changes, this index
is not available anymore starting with Eclipse 4.12.

The preference to enable it in *Preferences > Java* is removed and the old index will be always used.

NOTE: *Preferences > Java > Rebuild Index* button can be used to delete the existing index files and free disk space.


==== Debug

===== 'Run to Line' on Ctrl+Alt+Click in annotation ruler

A new shortcut, *Ctrl+Alt+Click*, has been added to the annotation ruler that will invoke the *'Run to Line'*
command and take the program execution to the line of invocation.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/run-to-line.png[]

===== Content assist in Debug Shell

Content assist (*Ctrl+Space*) support is now available in the *Debug Shell*.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/content-assist-debug-shell.png[]

===== Clear Java Stack Trace Console usage hint on first edit

The *Java Stack Trace Console* shows a usage hint when opened the first time. This message
is now automatically removed when the user starts typing or pasting a stack trace.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/jstc-initial-clear.png[]

===== Lambda variable names shown in Variables view

The Lambda variable names are now shown in the *Variables* view while debugging projects in the workspace.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.12/images/lambda-variables-view.png[]

==== JDT Developers

===== Support for new Javadoc tags

The following Javadoc tags are now supported by the compiler and auto-complete.

Tags introduced in JDK 8:

`@apiNote`

`@implSpec`

`@implNote`

Tags introduced in JDK 9:

`@index`

`@hidden`

`@provides`

`@uses`

Tags introduced in JDK 10:

`@summary`

=== And more...

You can find more noteworthy updates in on link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.11.0.Final.html[this page].

== What is next?

Having JBoss Tools 4.12.0 and Red Hat CodeReady Studio 12.12 out we are already working on the next release for Eclipse 2019-09.

Enjoy!
