Happy to announce link:/downloads/jbosstools/luna/4.2.0.Beta3.html[JBoss Tools 4.2 Beta3] and link:/downloads/devstudio/luna/8.0.0.Beta3.html[Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 8 Beta3] for Eclipse Luna is now available.

== Installation

JBoss Developer Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply link:/downloads/devstudio/luna/8.0.0.Beta3.html[download it] and install it like this:
 
    java -jar jboss-devstudio-{version}-installer-{standalone|eap}.jar   

JBoss Tools or JBoss Developer Studio Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) requires a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) but we recommend
using the
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/lunar[Eclipse
4.4 JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you either find us on Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools (Luna)" or "JBoss Developer Studio (Luna)".

For JBoss Tools you can also use our update site directly if you are up for it.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/luna/
 
Note: Integration Stack tooling will become available from JBoss Central at a later date.

== What is new ? 

This release is mainly a bunch of bug fixes but also a few new features and a very important regression fix.

=== Better Plugin Management for Apache Cordova

Our Hybrid Mobile Tools now supports automatically downloading the plugins listed in your `config.xml` giving you two benefits:

. Allow you to exclude the physical plugin binaries from your source control
. On import the right plugin will be fetched dynamically, great for sharing examples and code.

Also don't forget we have proposed and contributed Hybrid Mobile Tools at Eclipse under https://github.com/eclipse/thym[Eclipse Thym].

=== CordovaSim is now less meme-compatible

CordovaSim using Ripple had a "easter-egg" in the sense when you used a Cordova plugin that the Ripple engine did not understand would 
show a dialog titled "I Haz Cheeseburger?!?!". Great for those with a great love for internet memes but it was not very informative.

Now we provide a less meme heavy dialog letting the user know what plugin that is not supported and allow you to not have to see the message again.

Btw. if you use a popular and/or important plugin that is not supported open a jira or PR against CordovaSim.

== Ionic framework in palette

We've added support for http://www.ionicframework.com/[Ionic framework]. Ionic is a AngularJS based framework that provides nice mobile components that works
especially well with Cordova based application.

=== Maven Central archetype catalog

One of the improvements in m2e 1.5 for Luna was that it no longer by default download the Nexus indexes for all repositories by default. It was simply too slow.

Thus that had to go but by removingt this the list of archetypes for the 'New Maven Project' was heavily reduced.

In Beta3 we've added the Maven Central Archetype catalog meaning you get access to ~9600 archetypes in a few seconds vs several minutes in pre m2e 1.5 days.

=== Review commit changes when pushing to OpenShift

When pushing changes to OpenShift and you have uncommitted changes we now show a variation of the standard git commit dialog allowing you to 
be selective about what files you want to get committed/added before your push.

=== JMX Navigator grouping of connections

With all the great additions to the JMX tooling in last beta we realized the JMX Navigator view could benefit from having its connections grouped by type.

Allows you to more easily find what you are looking for and when auto-discovered connections come and go the view stays stable.

=== Fixed incremental deployment regression

...and finally we fixed a rather severe regression in our server tools. The server adapter were triggering full redeployments if your project had certain
type or module or jar dependencies. 

Making your development workflow really slow compared to the more or less instant feedback you should get when just updating dynamic content like html or jsf.

Sorry for having that broken but now it is fixed - thus if you felt the server publishing was slow then please try it now! It should be back to its fast self again.
 
== ...and more

There are more improvements covered in the more detailed: link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.2.0.Beta3.html[What's New].

== What is Next

This Beta is the last planned Beta for JBoss Tools 4.2 and Developer Studio 8. The next release is set to be the candidate release thus 
please do try this release out and give feedback to make sure you'll have a good experience with JBoss Tools on Eclipse Luna!

Let us know what you think in the comments below!

Hope you enjoy it and remember...

Have fun!
