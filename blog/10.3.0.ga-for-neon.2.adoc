== Installation

JBoss Developer Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio.html[JBoss Products page] and run it like this:
 
    java -jar jboss-devstudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) JBoss Developer Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.6.2 (Neon.2) but we recommend
using the latest http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neon2[Eclipse 4.6.2 Neon JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled. 

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

== What is new? 

Our main focus for this release was improvements for container based development and bug fixing.

=== Improved OpenShift 3 and Docker Tools

We continue to work on providing better experience for container based development in JBoss Tools and Developer Studio. Let's go through a few interesting updates here.

==== Scaling from pod resources

When an application is being deployed to Openshift, it was possible to scale the pod resources from the 
service resource.

However, it was not a very logical choice. So the command is also available at the pod level, leading to better usability.

==== OpenShift Container Platform 3.4 support

OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.4 has been
https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-breaks-down-barriers-enterprise-container-adoption-dynamic-storage-provisioning-latest-version-red-hat-openshift-container-platform[announced, window="_blank"] by Red Hat.
JBossTools 4.4.3 has been validated against OCP 3.4.

==== CDK 3 Beta Server Adapter

A new server adapter has been added to support the next generation of CDK 3. This is Tech Preview in this release as CDK 3 is Beta.
While the server adapter itself has limited functionality, it is able to start and stop the CDK virtual machine via its minishift binary.
Simply hit Ctrl+3 (Cmd+3 on OSX) and type CDK, that will bring up a command to setup and/or launch the CDK server adapter.
You should see the old CDK 2 server adapter along with the new CDK 3 one (labeled *Red Hat Container Development Kit 3 (Tech Preview)* ).

All you have to do is set the credentials for your Red Hat account and the location of the CDK’s minishift binary file and the type of virtualization hypervisor.

Once you’re finished, a new CDK Server adapter will then be created and visible in the Servers view.

Once the server is started, Docker and OpenShift connections should appear in their respective views, allowing the user to quickly create a new Openshift application and begin developing their AwesomeApp in a highly-replicatable environment.

WARNING: This is Tech Preview. The implementation is subject to change, may not work with next releases of CDK 3 and testing has been limited.
