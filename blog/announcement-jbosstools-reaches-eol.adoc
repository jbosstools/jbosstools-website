Hello to our dear JBoss community. 

We, the developer and our management team, have made the decision to no longer support Eclipe IDE for our tooling offering.

Our focus is to provide great tools to the developers, but with limited resources, we decided to focus on others IDEs, VScode and Intellij IDEA.
Our source code respositories are still open and available on https://github.com/jbosstools[GitHub]. 


It has been a great ride and we wish you all the best.

Thanks for everything and goodbye.

The JBoss Team
