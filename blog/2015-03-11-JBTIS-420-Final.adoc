The Integration Stack for JBoss Tools Developer Studio is a set of plugins for Eclipse that provides tooling for the following frameworks.

== JBoss Business Process and Rules Development

* link:/features/drools.html[Drools] - A Business Logic integration Platform which provides a unified and integrated platform for Rules, Workflow and Event Processing.
* link:/features/jbpm.html[jBPM] - A flexible Business Process Management (BPM) suite.

== JBoss Data Virtualization Development

* link:/features/modeshape.html[Modeshape] - A distributed, hierarchical, transactional and consistent data store with support for queries, full-text search, events, versioning, references, and flexible and dynamic schemas. It is very fast, highly available, extremely scalable, and it is 100% open source.
* link:/features/teiiddesigner.html[Teiid Designer] - A visual tool that enables rapid, model-driven definition, integration, management and testing of data services without programming using the Teiid runtime framework.

== JBoss Integration and SOA Development

* All of the Business Process and Rules Development plugins, plus...
* link:/features/apachecamel.html[Fuse Apache Camel Tooling] - A graphical tool for integrating software components that works with Apache ServiceMix, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel and the FuseSource distributions.

All of these components have been verified to work with the same dependencies as JBoss Tools 4.2 and Developer Studio 8.

== Installation

To install the Integration Stack tools, first install JBoss Developer Studio from the link:https://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio.html[all-in-one installer], bundled and configured out of the box with everything you need to get started. Alternatively, if you already have eclipse-jee-luna installed, you can install link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-luna[JBoss Developer Studio] or link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-tools-luna[JBoss Tools] from the Eclipse Marketplace via *Help > Eclipse Marketplace...*

Once Developer Studio is installed, restart Eclipse and select the Software/Update tab in the JBoss Central view.  The current 8.0.0.GA integration stack is available automatically with the released *JBoss Data Virtualization Development* tooling.  The remainder of the integration tooling is available as *Early Access* so you must check the *Enable Early Access* checkbox in the installer window in order to install.

=== Early Access Highlights

For more specifics see:

==== BPMN2 Modeler

* The Graphiti framework dependency was changed to require only 0.11. This is now aligned with the same version that is shipped with Eclipse Luna.
* BPMN 2.0 Model validation has been reworked to allow extension plug-ins to override specific model element constraints. See Bug 427470 for details.
* Double-click handling in the Outline and Problems views has been improved: a double-click on a node in the Outline view, or an error item in the Problems view will now display the Property sheet for the associated model object to allow immediate editing of the object.
* The editor now performs a Live validation just before saving a file, and cancels the save process if the model is found to be corrupt (invalid ID string, duplicate IDs, etc.) This prevents the model file from being corrupted.
* A new User Preference has been added to the Editor Behavior preference page, which allows Text fields to be limited to a maximum length. The default is 255 characters. Note that Multiline text boxes, such as those used for Documentation and Scripts, are not subject to this limit.
