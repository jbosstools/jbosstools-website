=== JBoss Tools 4.2.2 and JBoss Developer Studio Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE)

JBoss Tools and JBoss Developer Studio Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) require at least Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) but we recommend using the
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/lunasr1a[Eclipse Luna SR1a Java EE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled. Once you have installed Eclipse, you can find us on Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools (Luna)" or "JBoss Developer Studio (Luna)".

For JBoss Tools you can also use our update site directly if you are up for it.
