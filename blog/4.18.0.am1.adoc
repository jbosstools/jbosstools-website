=== Quarkus

==== Support for codestarts in New Quarkus project wizard

code.quarkus.io has added a new option codestart that allows extension that support
this new feature to contribute sample code in the generated project. It is enabled
by default and is accessible from the second step in the wizard:

=== OpenShift

==== Devfile based deployments

The Application Explorer view is now based on odo 2.x, which allows deployments
to be based on devfile (developer oriented manifest file). The components from
the default odo registry are listed with legacy S2I components:

It is also now possible to bootstrap from an empty project as the components
from the registry may expose starter projects (sample code that will initialize
your empty project).
