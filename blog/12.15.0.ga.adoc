== Installation

Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/[Red Hat CodeReady product page] and run it like this:

    java -jar codereadystudio-<installername>.jar

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.15 (2020-03) but we recommend
using the latest https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-03/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers[Eclipse 4.15 2020-03 JEE Bundle]
since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools" or "Red Hat CodeReady Studio".

For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.

    http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/photon/stable/updates/

== What is new?

Our main focus for this release was a new tooling for the Quarkus framework, improvements for container based development and bug fixing.
Eclipse 2020-03 itself has a lot of new cool stuff but let me highlight just a few updates in both Eclipse 2020-03 and JBoss Tools plugins that I think are worth mentioning.

=== OpenShift

==== OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 support

With the new OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.4 now available, JBoss Tools
is compatible with this major release in a transparent way. Just define your
connection to your OCP 4.4 based cluster as you did before for an OCP 3 cluster,
and use the tooling !

=== Quarkus

==== Language support for Kubernetes, Openshift, S2i and Docker properties

There is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for kubernetes.*,
openshift.*, s2i.*, docker.* properties

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus20.png[]

Enter `kubernetes` prefix:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus21.png[]

Enter `openshift` prefix:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus22.png[]

Enter `s2i` prefix:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus23.png[]

== Language support for MicroProfile REST Client properties

Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the
MicroProfile properties from REST Client.

After registering a REST client using `@RegisterRestClient` like so:
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient
public interface MyServiceClient {
	@GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----

The related MicroProfile Rest config properties will have language feature support
(completion, hover, validation, etc.).

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus24.png[]

Change the Java code so that the configuration key is changed:
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "myclient")
public interface MyServiceClient {
	@GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----

and notice the code assist is changed accordingly:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus25.png[]

== Language support for MicroProfile Health

Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the
MicroProfile Health artifacts.

So if you have the following Health class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Health;

@Health
public class MyHealth {

}
----

you will get a validation error (as the class does not implement the `HealthCheck`
interface:

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus26.png[]

Similarly, if you have a class that implements `HealthCheck` but is not annotated with `Health`, some workflow applies:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

public class MyHealth implements HealthCheck {

	@Override
	public HealthCheckResponse call() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return null;
	}

}
----

you will get a validation message (as the class is not annotated with `Health`
interface):

image::/documentation/whatsnew/quarkus/images/quarkus27.png[]

As there are several ways to fix the problem, then several quick fixes are proposed.

==== Better extensions reporting in the Quarkus project wizard

With the Quarkus extensions ecosystem growing, we improved information about extensions
in the Quarkus project wizard.

When you select an extension in the wizard, you will see the extension description in the
lower side of the wizard. If the extension has a guide on the Quarkus web site, a link
will also be displayed and clicking on that link will open the guide on your local web
browser.

=== Hibernate Tools

==== Hibernate Runtime Provider Updates

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

===== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.14.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.14.Final.

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.16.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.16.Final.


=== Platform

==== Views, Dialogs and Toolbar

===== Hierarchical project layout by default in Project Explorer

To better handle multi-module, nested and hierarchical projects, the default project
layout in *Project Explorer* view has been changed from _Flat_ to _Hierarchical_.

You can restore the layout to _Flat_ using the view menu (⋮).

==== Debug

===== Console View now interprets form feed and vertical tab characters

The interpretation of ASCII control characters in the *Console View* was extended to
recognize the characters: `\f` - form feed and `\v` - vertical tab (in languages that support it).

This feature is disabled by default. You can enable it on the *Run/Debug > Console*
preference page. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/formfeed.png[]

===== Termination time in Console View

The *Console View* label will now show the termination time of a process in addition
to the launch time.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/process-termination-time.png[]

==== Preferences

===== Preference to select resource rename mode

A preference has been added in the *General* preferences page, that allows you to
select the resource renaming mode in the *Project Explorer*: either open an inlined
text field or a dialog. By default, the inline rename mode is selected.

The preference can also be specified via product customization:

- org.eclipse.ui.workbench/RESOURCE_RENAME_MODE=inline
- org.eclipse.ui.workbench/RESOURCE_RENAME_MODE=dialog

NOTE: Rename that would affect more than 1 resource is always performed with a dialog.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/resource-rename-mode-preference.png[]

==== Themes and Styling 

===== Welcome screen in dark theme

When Eclipse is in dark theme, the welcome screen also appears dark on macOS and Linux.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/dark_welcome.png[]

==== General Updates

===== Interactive performance

Interactive performance has been further improved in this release.

===== Redraw is turned off by default during collapse and expand operations in tree viewer

To improve interactive performance, redraw is turned off by default during the collapse
and expand operation of tree viewers. This significantly improves these operations
compared to drawing the updates synchronously. 

 
=== Java Developement Tools (JDT)

==== Java 14 Support

===== Java 14

Java™ 14 is available and Eclipse JDT supports Java 14 for the Eclipse 4.15 release. 

The release notably includes the following Java 14 features:

- JEP 361: Switch Expressions (Standard).
- JEP 359: Records (Preview).
- JEP 368: Text Blocks (Second Preview).
- JEP 305: Pattern Matching for Instanceof (Preview). 

Please note that preview option should be on for preview language features.
For an informal introduction of the support, please refer to https://wiki.eclipse.org/Java14/Examples[Java 14 Examples wiki]. 


==== Java Editor

===== Subword code completion

Content Assist now supports subword patterns, similar to Eclipse Code Recommenders
and other IDEs. For example, completing on `addmouselistener` proposes results
like `addMouseMoveListener` and `addMouseWheelListener`.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/subword-code-completion.png[]

This feature can be enabled using the *Show subword matches* option on the
*Java > Editor > Content Assist* preference page.

===== Subtype code completion

Content Assist will prioritize displaying constructor completions whose declaring type
inherits from the expected return type within the completion context.

For example, completing on :

`Queue<String> queue = new L`

prioritizes constructors for `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingDeQueue` 
and `LinkedList`.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/subtype-code-completion.png[]

===== Option for non-blocking Java completion

Code completion in the Java editor can now be run in a separate non-UI thread
to prevent UI freezes in case of long computations. To enable this non-blocking
computation, go to *Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Advanced*
and check *Do not block UI Thread while computing completion proposals*
preference. This option is currently disabled by default.

Non-blocking completion is useful when completion proposals are long to compute,
as it allows you to type or use other parts of the IDE in the meantime.

Some completion participants may prevent this option from being effective (typically
if the Java completion extension doesn't declare `requiresUIThread="false"`),
so the UI thread may still be used even if this option is set.

===== Quick fix to wrap Optional statements

A quick fix has been added to wrap an `Optional` statement.

The options for a primitive statement are: `Optional.empty()` and `Optional.of()`.
Type statements also have `Optional.ofNullable()`.

Example for type objects:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/wrapOptional1.png[]

Selecting *Wrap with nullable Optional* for type object results in:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/wrapOptional4.png[]

Example for primitive:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/wrapOptional2.png[]

Selecting *Wrap with Optional* for primitive results in:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/wrapOptional3.png[]

===== Simplify functional interface instances

A new clean up has been added that simplifies the lambda expression and the method
reference syntax and is enabled only for Java 8 and higher.

The clean up removes parenthesis for a single untyped parameter, return statement
for a single expression and brackets for a single statement. It replaces a lambda
expression by a creation or a method reference when possible.

To select the clean up, invoke *Source > Clean Up...*, use a custom profile, and on
the *Configure...* dialog select *Simplify lambda expression and method reference syntax*
on the *Code Style* tab. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/lambda-expression-enhancements.png[]

For the given code:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/lambda-expression-enhancements-before.png[]

You get this after the clean up:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/lambda-expression-enhancements-after.png[]

===== Directly use Map method

Some map manipulations are unnecessarily verbose. The new cleanup option *Operate
on Maps* directly calls methods on a map instead of calling the same methods on the
key set or the values.

Beware! If you create Map implementations that don't follow the `Map` specification,
this cleanup may break the behavior (a `size()` method that changes the values,
an iterator that destroys the items...). 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/map-method-preferences.png[]

For the given code:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/map-method-before.png[]

You get this after the clean up:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/map-method-after.png[]

===== Uppercase for long literal suffix

A new cleanup option *Use uppercase for long literal suffix* has been added. It will rewrite
long literals like `101l` with an uppercase L like `101L` to avoid ambiguity. 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/uppercase-literal-suffix.png[]

===== Surround with "try-with-resources" block

Corresponding to the quick fix which will surround a selection with a "try-with-resources"
block, a new action has been added to the *Surround With* menu.

For example, selecting the lines as shown:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/surroundwithresources1.png[]

and right-clicking and selecting *Surround With -> Try-with-resources Block*

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/surroundwithresources.png[]

results in:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/surroundwithresources2.png[]

===== Quick fixes for module-info Javadoc

Quick fixes have been added to fix the missing and duplicate `@provides` and `@uses` Javadoc
tags in a `module-info` file.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/modulequickfix.png[]

===== No more spurious semicolon from import completion

Almost 18 years ago, it was reported that completion for imports adds an unnecessary
semicolon if one already exists (like when changing an existing import). Now this extra
semicolon is no longer inserted. 

==== Java Compiler

===== Warn when legacy code can taint null-checked values

When using null-annotations for advanced null analysis, it is inherently tricky
to combine your code with "legacy" code that has no null annotations and has not been
blessed by such analysis.

Previously, Eclipse would only warn you when you _obtain_ a dubious value _from_ a
legacy API, but it would keep silent in the opposite case: _passing_ a value of an
annotated type _into_ legacy API. Still in specific situations this can cause a
NullPointerException to be thrown in your null-checked code: 

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/null-into-nonnull-list.png[]

The console shows an exception thrown from within your checked main method (see
the class-level `@NonNullByDefault`). It also shows the new warning, which Eclipse
raises to alert you of this danger.

_Hint_: The shown code assumes the list `names` to have type `List<@NonNull String>`,
but the legacy method `Legacy.printNames()` succeeds to taint this list by inserting
a `null` element. This goes unnoticed because that method views the list has having type
`List<String>`, with no nullness constraint on the type argument.

By default this problem is raised at level `info`, but the severity can be configured in the compiler settings:

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/configure-null-vs-legacy-problem.png[]

===== Improved Resource leak analysis

Resource leak analysis has been improved in several ways.

Most importantly, the analysis now consistently considers resources (=values of type
`AutoCloseable`) which are acquired using a method call, where previously under
some circumstances resource allocation got unnoticed if it was wrapped in a factory
method, like in the following example: 

```java
makePrintWriter("/tmp/log.txt").printf("%d", 42);
// a PrintWriter is never closed!
```

Second, resource leak analysis now leverages knowledge about well-known resource classes
that support fluent programming, i.e., instance methods which return `this` to enable
chains of method calls. Where a naive analysis could consider the method result
as a new resource coming into scope, special knowledge about these classes informs
the analysis that it is one and the same resource. This concerns the following
system classes:

*from java.io*::
CharArrayWriter, Console, PrintStream, PrintWriter, StringWriter, Writer

*from java.nio.channels*::
AsynchronousFileChannel, AsynchronousServerSocketChannel, FileChannel, NetworkChannel, SeekableByteChannel, SelectableChannel, Selector, ServerSocketChannel

*from java.util*::
Formatter

The following example is now understood to be safe, because analysis understands
that the resource returned by `append()` is the same as the initial `pw`:

```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("/tmp/log.txt");
pw.printf("%d", 42).append(" is the answer").close();
```

Generally, resource leak analysis was made more precise regarding several specific situations.

==== Java Formatter

===== Java formatter application requires a workspace

The Java formatter application will provide a sensible error message if a workspace is
required but not provided (`-data` command line option). This also enables the `-help`
option to be run on the formatter without a workspace specified.

A new bundle services the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCodeFormatter` application.
This new bundle is part of the JDT feature. Users who are not using the JDT feature to
define their set of bundles will need to add
`org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatterapp` to their set of bundles.

==== Debug

===== Functional debug expressions

Lambda expressions and method references are now supported in debug expressions,
such as in the *Expressions view* and in breakpoint condition expressions.

image::https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.15/images/debug-functional-expressions.png[]


==== JDT Developers

===== New bundle org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatterapp

The entry point of the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCodeFormatter` application has been moved
to a new bundle, `org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatterapp`.
