I believe very much in our tools are only as good as our users think they are.

As an opensource project we have always said that any input or
contribution are welcome but sometimes I feel many are interested in
helping out but not sure where to go.

I also believe a special attribute of IDE's in general are that
there is about the same amount of usecases for the IDE as there are
users.

As an IDE we are really interested in hearing about such usescases,
but also making sure those usecases you as a user are using
with the tools (within reason :) continue to support and work
with them.

Today I'm glad to say we are introducing JBoss Tools Community Acceptance Testing (CAT)
to try address these concerns.

== What is it ?

JBoss Tools CAT is a program where you signup
and give feedback on new features and we will help you in any issues you have.
We'll also be doing some surveys where JBoss Tools CAT members where you get to tell us if
you find JBoss Tools are ready to be released or not. 

You can see the details about the program at the link:/cat[CAT] page.

== How do I participate ?

If you are interested in participating please go and link:http://bit.ly/jbosstoolscatsignup[Register!]

== What is in it for me ?

Besides you being able to influence the readyness of JBoss Tools for your usecases we will also at 
the release of the final JBoss Tools put your name as part of the release and dependent on the number
of participants give out some extra prizes.

You can see more at link:/cat[the JBoss Tools CAT] web page.

Lets Have fun!
