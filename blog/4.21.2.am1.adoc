== What is New?

Full info is at link:/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.21.2.AM1.html[this page]. Some highlights are below.


=== Quarkus Tools

== Quarkus stream selection in the new Quarkus project wizard

When a new Quarkus project/module is to be generated, it is now possible to select the Quarkus stream (see https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-2x-platform-quarkiverse-registry/[this article]) on which the generated application will be based on.

By default, the recommended (latest release) will be selected but you can choose another one:

== Enhanced code completion in Java files

When you want to define a fallback method thanks to the `@Fallback` annotation from MicroProfile Fault Tolerance, the code completion is activated on the `fallbackMethod` member and will propose you available target methods.

== Quarkus launch configuration workspace resolution


When you define a Quarkus launch/debug configuration, it is linked to a specific project from your workspace. If this project has a dependency on another project from the workspace, it will be resolved against the workspace and you don't have to install the dependency in the local Maven/Gradle cache so that it can be resolved.



=== Hibernate Tools

A number of additions and updates have been performed on the available Hibernate runtime  providers.

==== Runtime Provider Updates

The Hibernate 5.6 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.6.1.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.6.1.Final.

The Hibernate 5.4 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.4.8.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.4.8.Final.

The Hibernate 5.3 runtime provider now incorporates Hibernate Core version 5.3.24.Final and Hibernate Tools version 5.3.24.Final.


Enjoy!
