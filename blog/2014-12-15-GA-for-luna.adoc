== Installation

JBoss Developer Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply link:/downloads/devstudio/luna/8.0.1.GA.html[download it] and install it like this:

    java -jar jboss-devstudio-{version}-installer-{standalone|eap}.jar

JBoss Tools or JBoss Developer Studio Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) requires a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) but we recommend using the
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/lunasr1[Eclipse Luna SR1 Java EE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools (Luna)" or "JBoss Developer Studio (Luna)".

For JBoss Tools you can also use our update site directly if you are up for it.

The Arquillian validator creates a marker and a quick fix if a test contains a deployment method that is not public and/or static.

== CDI auto enablement for Java EE 7 projects

CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) support is now enabled automatically for Eclipse Web Tools faceted projects if they have any Java EE 7 facet.
For example if you create a project via New Dynamic Web Project Wizard and selected Web facet v.3.1 you don't need to enable CDI support in project properties or to install CDI facet. CDI Tools will do it automatically.

== Updated Forge 2 Runtime 	

The included Forge 2 runtime is now 2.12.3.Final.

== What is Next

More maintenance updates for Eclipse Luna are planned and we continue to work on the major release for Eclipse Mars but it's all for 2015!

Happy Holidays and a joyful New Year!
