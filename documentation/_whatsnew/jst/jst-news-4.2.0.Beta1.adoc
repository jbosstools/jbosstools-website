== Non-standard HTML attribute validation (e.g. ng-*)

It's now possible to ignore non-standard HTML attributes. JBT team contributed that feature to Eclipse Luna (Milestone 6). This is typically needed when developing Angular JS applications as the HTML validator considers Angular JS ng-* attributes as invalid html (which is actually correct since the proper syntax to be 100% compatible with the html5 spec is to use data-ng-*).

Since JBoss Tools 4.2.0.Beta1 if you holding *Ctrl* (for Linux and Windows) or *Alt/Option* (for Mac) when the widget is dropped to the HTML Editor then the code snippet is inserted without any dialog.
