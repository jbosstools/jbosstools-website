== Show in Cheat Sheets view. 	

There is now a new action in the "Show in" context menu: the Show in Cheat Sheets action.

This allow you to easily re-open or test a cheatsheet.xml found in examples.

The action is enabled for the Java, J2EE, JBoss and PDE perspectives.

== New cheatsheet commands 	

We have added new context sensitive parameterized commands for open file, show type etc. The commands can be used when creating cheatsheets.

|getProjectForCheatsheet
|Used to store currentProject so you can refer to it in other commands

|openFileInEditor(path,fromLine,toLine)
|Used to open a file in an editor and highlight lines of a text from fromLine to toLine

These commands can be used like any other command in a cheatsheet. Example of this working in a project can be found at helloworld-cheatsheet
