== A new design 	

The JBoss Central UI has been reworked to, hopefully, provide a better user experience. So, in no particular order, you'll see :

* A description of each wizard is available when hovering on each project icon
* Blogs, news and twitter feeds have been aggregated into one section now known as JBoss Buzz
* The "show on startup" preference is now directly accessible from the top of the page
* A new link to the Ticket Monster tutorial has been added
* Quickstarts are now more visible
