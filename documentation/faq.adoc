Why does the visual part in the visual editor not work ?::
  The Visual Page Editor uses the last XULRunner that have a Java API to do its visual rendering which unfortunately limits which operating systems it can run on and in some cases some pacakges needs to be installed on your OS for it to work. You can see link:https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBosstoolsVisualEditorFAQ[Visual Page Editor FAQ] for possible solutions/workaround.
Which operating systems, runtimes and frameworks does JBoss Tools support ?::
  In general JBoss Tools attempt to ensure you can continue to use both old and new runtimes/frameworks with its releases but we do not go back to old streams and add new features. Thus if you want the latest greatest runtime support use the latest releases.
