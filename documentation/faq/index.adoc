=== Server/Publishing

[qanda]
I use eclipse with the jboss tools installed, is there any way to republish my app that doesnt involve what feels like 50 clicks by opening server tab, expanding server, right clicking the module and selecting full publish?::

Use menu:Help[Key assist] and a yellow window pops up with current keyboard shortcuts. Type "Full" and a "Full Publish module" should show up with the right key.
It is a bit long, but you can reconfigure it if you wish to under menu:Preferences[General, Keys].

=== LiveReload

[qanda]
I use JBoss Tools with LiveReload enabled, but my HTML Page did not refresh as expected after I published a change on the application server.::

The LiveReload tooling is notified by the Server tooling when a resource was published on the application server. But there may be a slight delay before the application server actually handles the resource change.
In the mean time, the user may still access the old resource in a response to an HTTP request.

To circumvent this problem, the LiveReload server configuration editor provides a "Reload delay" property that can be adjusted to give enough time
to the application server to detect and take into account the changes before the web browser sends its HTTP request. The default value is 500ms.
