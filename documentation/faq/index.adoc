Why does the visual part in the visual editor not work?::
  The Visual Page Editor uses the last XULRunner that have a Java API to do its visual rendering which unfortunately limits which operating systems it can run on and in some cases some pacakges needs to be installed on your OS for it to work. You can see link:https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBosstoolsVisualEditorFAQ[Visual Page Editor FAQ] for possible solutions/workaround.

Which operating systems, runtimes and frameworks does JBoss Tools support?::
  In general JBoss Tools attempts to ensure you can continue to use both old and new runtimes &amp; frameworks with its releases but we do not add new features to old streams. Support for the latest &amp; greatest runtimes will only be available in the latest releases.

=== Server/Publishing

[qanda]
I use eclipse with the jboss tools installed, is there any way to republish my app that doesnt involve what feels like 50 clicks by opening server tab, expanding server, right clicking the module and selecting full publish?::

Use menu:Help[Key assist] and a yellow window pops up with current keyboard shortcuts. Type "Full" and a "Full Publish module" should show up with the right key.
It is a bit long, but you can reconfigure it if you wish to under menu:Preferences[General, Keys].
