== Refactor Arquillian validator 	

Now, the Arquillian validator uses AST to search for dependencies.
This way, performance are significantly improved because we don't have to create Arquillian archive(s) anymore.
Likewise, the Arquillian validator is implemented as an Eclipse builder instead of JDT compiler participant which improves its stability.

== ShrinkWrap Archive name/type validation 	

The Arquillian validator checks if an archive name extension matches an archive type.
