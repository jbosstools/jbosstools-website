== Arquillian Eclipse 	

Arquillian Eclipse is a new JBoss Tools component that makes using Arquillian easier.

See Arquillian Eclipse.

== Add/Remove Arquillian Support 	

The Arquillian support can be added/removed by right-clicking the project and selecting Configure>Add/Remove Arquillian support.

The project has to be a maven project. The Add Arquillian Support action adds the Arquillian nature to the project as well as the arquillian artifacts (bom, dependencies, required plugins, profiles ...) to the project's pom.xml. The Remove Arquillian Support removes the Arquillian nature, but doesn't change the project's pom.xml.

image::images/arquilliantab.png[]

The Run As Arquillian launch configuration includes the following features:

* is activated only if there is the org.jboss.arquillian.junit.Arquillian class
* runs only Arquillian JUnit tests
* checks if there is exactly one implementation of the org.jboss.arquillian.container.spi.client.container.DeployableContainer interface
* includes the Arquillian tab that enables the user to check/change the Arquillian configuration properties, select maven profiles, review/start/stop WTP servers. The Arquillian configuration properties are added using declarations from the arquillian.xml, arquillian.properties and the default values when instantiating the corresponding container configuration.
