== Navigation between pages on single-page application

For single-page applications, the Visual Editor supports navigation between pages. However, there were problems returning to the previous page in the editor. To address this issue, Visual Editor now includes `Back` and `Forward` buttons in the menu bar which improve single-page application development.
