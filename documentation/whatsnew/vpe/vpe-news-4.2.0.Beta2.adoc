== HTML Preview as a separate plugin
HTML Preview is a WYSIWYG plugin for HTML pages. Preview is not coupled with a particular editor, but editor must have DOM model support. HTML Preview has several cool features like:

 -  automatic refresh (enabled by default)
 -  refresh on save
 -  navigation from source to view and vice versa

== HTML Preview as a part of VPE

HTML Preview could also be treated as a possible XULRunner substitution for plain HTML pages (JSF/xhtml still requires XULRunner). The point is that, when XULRunner is unavailable, HTML Preview will be used in "Visual/Source" and "Preview" tabs of the https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-vpe[VPE].
