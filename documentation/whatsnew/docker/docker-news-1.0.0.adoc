Tooling for Docker is available in Eclipse Mars under the http://eclipse.org/linuxtools[Linux tools]
umbrella but despite this name, it works on all major developer platforms. It
is mirrored on http://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/mars/4.3.0.Beta1.html[JBoss Tools update site]
and included in Developer Studio 9.0.0.Beta1, too.

== "Run Image" wizard

The new "Run Image" wizard lets users run an Image by passing the arguments that we think are the most relevant in the context of a developer machine:

- the name of the container (although this is optional)
- the exposed ports (the table is prefilled with port numbers retrieved from the selected Image info)
- the links to containers
- the data volume
- the environment variables

The wizard also lets user search and pull an image from the Docker Registry

== Properties view

The Properties view responds to the selection on an Image or a Container in the aforementioned views to display general and detailled information
