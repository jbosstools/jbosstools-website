== "Run Image" wizard

The new "Run Image" wizard lets users run an image by passing the most relevant arguments in the context of a developer machine:

- the name of the container (although this is optional)
- the exposed ports (the table is prepopulated with port numbers retrieved from the selected Image information)
- the links to containers
- the data volume
- the environment variables
