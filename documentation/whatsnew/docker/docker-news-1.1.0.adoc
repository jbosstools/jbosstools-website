== Improved Docker Explorer View

We've added icon decorators on the containers to show their state. This makes it
clearer if a container is running, paused or stopped.

== New Dialog to Search and Pull Images

We've worked on the workflow to pull and search images from Docker Hub.
 The updated `Pull Image` wizard can be launched from the `Docker Images` view
 or from the `Docker Explorer` view (a new context menu entry is available on the
connection node and on the `Images` node)

The wizard detects the tag in the image name and if none is specified, the image tagged `latest`
will be pulled.

If the user needs to search a specific image name, she can click on the `Search...` button
which will open the `Search` wizard:

followed by a second page that displays all the tags for the selected image:

Even though this wizard can only search from Docker Hub, users can nonetheless pull images
from other third-party registries. In that case, image name needs to be prefixed with the
registry host and port, such as `192.168.59.103:5000/centos:7`.

== New Launcher to Build a Docker Image

Finally, we`ve also added a new launcher to build images from a Dockerfile.

The `source path` is a directory in the workspace or on the file system and the
`Docker Connection` combo box specifies on which Docker daemon the image will
be built.

== Improved Connection Wizard

The connection wizard did not change on the surface but it was almost fully
 rewritten inside to better validate the input settings. The wizard now
 requires a unique name ot identify the connection and checks the required 
 permissions on the Unix socket and on the path to the certificates for TCP
 connections.
