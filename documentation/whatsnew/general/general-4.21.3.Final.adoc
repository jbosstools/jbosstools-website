== General for JBoss Tools 4.21.3.Final

JBoss Tools is now targeting Eclipse 2021-09.

=== Platform

==== Apache Log4j CVEs

The platform now embeds Apache Log4j 2.17.1.

So the following CVEs:

- CVE-2021-44228
- CVE-2021-45046
- CVE-2021-45105
- CVE-2021-44832

have been fixed.

As Apache Log4j 1.x is also embedded but is not maintained anymore, the Apache Log4j bundle (1.2.15) has been patched in order to remove:

- JMSSink
- JBDCAppender
- Chainsaw
