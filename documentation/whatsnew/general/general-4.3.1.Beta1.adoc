== Improvements on the Importer wizard

The Import wizard that you can access via _File > Import Projects from Folder..._, _File > Import... > General > Projects from Folder_ or _File > Import... > Git > Projects from Git (auto-import)_ allows more user control. You can now see a proposal for the import (what will be imported and how) and select which sub-projects to import or not.

Performances have also been highly improved, and importing a Maven project will now suggest installation of m2e connectors when necessary.
