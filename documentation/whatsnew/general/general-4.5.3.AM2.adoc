== Credentials Framework

=== Sunsetting jboss.org credentials

`Download Runtimes` and `CDK Server Adapter` used the credentials framework to manage credentials. However, the JBoss.org credentials cannot be used any more
as the underlying service used by these components does not support these credentials.

The credentials framework still supports the JBoss.org credentials in case other services / components require or use this credentials domain.
