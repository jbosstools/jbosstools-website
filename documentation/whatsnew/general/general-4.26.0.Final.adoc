== Components removal

As planned and communicated in a previous blog article, the following components have been
removed from the JBoss Tools distribution:

- Forge
- Livereload
- Angular
- JSDT

Please note that the following components are obsoleted so they are still part of this JBoss
Tools distribution but they will be removed from the next JBoss Tools release:

- WebServices
- JSF
- Seam
- Batch
- Visual Page Editor
- Central installation
