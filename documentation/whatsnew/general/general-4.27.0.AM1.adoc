== Components Depreciation

As previously announced https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-28678[here], we're in the process to remove the Central / update tab from JBossTools in next release. This work can be followed https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-28852[here]. 

That means that all the current extra features that can be installed via this tab needs to be available through a new channel. This channel already exists as p2 repo, but using https://www.eclipse.org/mpc/[Eclipse Marketplace Client] is more close to what's existing right now. 

Most of those additional features are already present in the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-tools[Jboss marketplace entry], so it's just a matter of use it to install your favorite feature.
