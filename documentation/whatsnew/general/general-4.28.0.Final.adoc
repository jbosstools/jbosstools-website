== Components Depreciation

As communicated in a previous blog article, the following components are now deprecated:

- Openshift CDK Tooling
- Openshift Explorer view (already hidden by default) and wizards, targeting Openshift v3

The current openshift Application Explorer view, based on odo v3 is now the default supported tooling.
