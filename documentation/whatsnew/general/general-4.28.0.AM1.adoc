== Components Removal
As previously announced https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-28678[here], we've removed the Central / update tab, SEAM and JSF support from JBossTools. 

For central update tab, all the existing central extensions can be installed with the marketplace client, using the entries listed https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBIDE-28853[here.]

== Future releases cadences
Starting from 4.28.0.Final, there will be no more .AM1 releases. The .Final releases can be now scheduled close to the Eclipse releases.
