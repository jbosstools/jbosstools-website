== EcmaScript 2015 

An important part of rebooting the JavaScript Development Tools (JSDT) project was updating the JavaScript language level supported with JSDT. Obsolete parser/compiler tool chain was replaced with http://esprima.org/[esprima] parser that supports the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) which is the latest JavaScript specification release at this time:

More information about *EcmaScript 2015*  improvements can be found in the Eclipse may newsletter article http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2016/may/article2.php[JSDT, meet EcmaScript 2015]

== Node.js Support

Node.js runtime definition is now available via Eclipse *Preferences -> JavaScript -> Runtimes*:

Also there is a new Node Launch configuration for running / debugging Node.js applications:

The process of debugging has been significantly improved. Now all debugging happens directly in the `JSDT` editor:

While debugging, all JavaScript variables will be available in the *Variables* view:

Hovering over variables in the editor is also supported:
