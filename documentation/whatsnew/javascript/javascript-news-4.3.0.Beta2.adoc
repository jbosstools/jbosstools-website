== Bower support

We are pleased to introduce the brand new http://bower.io/[Bower] Tools. Bower is a front-end package manager that fetches and installs frameworks, libraries,  and assets. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file named `bower.json`.

=== Prerequisites

JBoss Bower Tools fall back on *native* Node.js and Bower calls. As a result, the following software must be installed before using Bower Tools:

* Node.js
* npm
* Bower

TIP: Installation instructions for *Node.js* and *npm* are available here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[here]. Bower is a command line utility installed via the npm command `npm install -g bower`

=== User Manual

With the current implementation, only the *http://bower.io/docs/api/#init[init]* and *http://bower.io/docs/api/#update[update]* commands from the Bower API are supported. Initialize Bower by selecting *File -> New... -> Other...* and choosing *Bower Init* wizard:

This wizard creates the `bower.json` file depending on a set of preferences:

Click *"Finish"* to create a `bower.json` file in the specified directory:

Add new dependencies by specifying them in `bower.json`:

Update dependencies by right-clicking `bower.json` -> *Run As...* -> *Bower Update*.

TIP: In most cases *Bower* and *Node.js* will be automatically detected. However, if the detection fails, a warning dialog box appears:

The *"Bower Update"* launch shortcut makes a native call which installs the required packages or updates according to `bower.json`:

The specified packages are created in the `bower_components` folder after *"Bower Update"* execution:

In conclusion, users can now use these packages for future front-end development.
