== JavaScript Development Tools improvements

JSDT now provides an option to turn off internal parsing and validation which could be useful for users who work with big projects where JavaScript is not the main part ov development by reducing the memory/performance requirements. Also the option could be useful when JSDT is used with 3rd-party tools those provide Content Assisting and Validation for JavaScripts.

For such a projects the "External Builder/Validator" mode can be selected for ECMAScript compliance level preference on Window->Preferences->JavaScript->Validator preference page:
