== General

=== Quick Access to Launch LiveReload

Users can now launch LiveReload from the 'Quick Access' menu, or using the
  Ctrl+3 (or Cmd+3) keyboard shortcut.

This will first display the dialog to create and start a LiveReload
  server. Then, this will open the current element (a selected file in the
  Project Explorer, a selected module in the Servers view or the content of the active editor)
  in the browser, without even having to use the 'Open With>Web Browser via LiveReload Server' contextual menu.
