== Content assist for Angular expressions

We are happy to introduce our new dynamic content assist for Angular expressions +{{expression}}+ 
which is based on information collected from AngularJS runtime model via AngularJS API.
When the content assist for any +{{expression}}+ is being invoked within any HTML file 
with some attached controller and there is no any critical errors in the file and required JS files 
then we run an internal web browser behind the scenes to retrieve all available JS objects.

== Custom HTML Tag Validation

HTML validation in Eclipse Web Tools had an annoying issue with custom HTML5 tags. It warns about any HTML tag name that is not mentioned in the HTML specification.
We contributed a patch to Eclipse Mars which allows to disable those warnings for any particular tag name (or a tag name mask, e.g. <ion-*>).
