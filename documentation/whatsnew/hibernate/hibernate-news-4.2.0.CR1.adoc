== Hibernate 4.3 and JPA 2.1

Hibernate Tools now supports JPA 2.1 and can now work with Hibernate 4.3 (while still continuing to work with Hibernate 3.x and previous 4.x).

Due to API changes in Hibernate 4.3, the Hibernate tools API is rewired to reduce classloader issues but some issues may occur despite the implemented fixes. In the future (possibly in the next major release), Hibernate Tools will be fully decouples from the underlying Hibernate Core to continue supporting multiple versions.
