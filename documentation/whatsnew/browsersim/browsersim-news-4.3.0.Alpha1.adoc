== JavaFx web engine support for BrowserSim standalone 

For one who does not use Eclipse / JBoss Developer Studio there is a standalone mode of BrowserSim. However, only `SWT WebKit` web engine used to be supported. Now there is a possibility to run BrowserSim standalone against `JavaFx` web engine which provides features like *Dev Tools Debugger* and *JavaScript logging* in the console.

== Security note for "Remote" proxy in CordovaSim

Now there is a security warning for *"Remote"* proxy. Basically, If the app is transferring sensitive data (authentication tokens, credentials etc.), it is strongly recommended  to use *"Local"* proxy instead of the *"Remote"* one.
