== Prompt user to save the current open editor before executing a command

When `Ctrl` (Or `CMD` in OSX) + `4` are pressed and the file is changed but not yet saved, Forge will display a confirmation dialog asking the user to save the current open file:

You can check the `Always save before opening the command dialog` checkbox to avoid displaying the confirmation dialog. This setting can be changed anytime in the `Preferences` dialog under the `Forge` category:
