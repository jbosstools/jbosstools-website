Starting the Forge 2 runtime is now achieved using the Ctrl+4 (or Cmd+4) key combination, the same as for Forge 1 runtimes. When multiple Forge runtimes are installed this key combination starts the default Forge runtime, which is specified and changeable in the Forge preferences.

== Forge 2 Wizards

As well as starting the Forge runtime, pressing Ctrl+4 (or Cmd+4) opens a window listing available Forge wizards. 
The list of wizards is responsive, changing based on the currently selected workspace object. The image below illustrates the available wizards when nothing in particular was selected.

As you can see, there are wizards for creating database connection profiles, for managing Forge addons and for creating
a new project.

When a project is selected while pressing the magic key combination, more wizards become available as illustrated in the image below.

== Forge 2 Command Line Interface

The wizards above are also available as commands on the Forge command line. Open the Forge Console by navigating through the Eclipse menu (Window->Show View->Other...->Forge->Forge Console) or by typing in the Quick Access text field.

The image below illustrates the available commands in the workspace root.
