== CDI 1.2

CDI Tools now support CDI 1.2 projects. If your CDI project (with enabled CDI support) has CDI 1.2 JARs in its classpath, CDI Tools will recognize it as CDI 1.2 project automatically. There is no need to use any special settings to distinguish CDI 1.2 from CDI 1.1 or 1.0.

== CDI Auto Enablement for JavaEE 7 Projects 

CDI Tools will automatically enable CDI support for the project when any of JavaEE 7 facet are being installed: Web (Servlet) 3.1 or higher, EJB 3.2 or higher or Utility module.
For example if you create a brand new Web Dynamic project with Web (Servlet) version 3.1 and any JavaEE 7 targeting server you don't have to enable CDI support manually via project settings. It will be enabled automatically.  
And as before JBoss Tools also enables CDI support for the maven projects if the project has CDI dependencies (requires maven CDI integration plugin to be installed).

== Proper Validation Problem Messages Dependent on CDI Version

Each CDI validation problem message refers to the corresponding CDI specification paragraph. Message and specification referrals are now depends on the CDI version used in the project.
For example:

1. "There is no class "org.domain.ClassName" [JSR-299 §8.2]" - CDI 1.0 validation message for non-existing class in beans.xml 
2. "There is no class "org.domain.ClassName" [JSR-346 §8.2]" - CDI 1.1 validation message
