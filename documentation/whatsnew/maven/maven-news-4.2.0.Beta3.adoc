== JBoss Maven Integration
=== Maven Central Archetype catalog  	

Since m2e 1.5.0 no longer downloads Nexus Indexes by default, a very small, outdated subset of Maven Archetypes is available out of the box.

To mitigate that, the JBoss Tools Maven integration feature now registers by default the Maven Central Archetype catalog, 
providing more than 9600 archetypes to chose from, when creating a new Maven project. Accessing the complete list of archetypes 
is even way, way faster (a few seconds) than relying on the old Nexus index download.
