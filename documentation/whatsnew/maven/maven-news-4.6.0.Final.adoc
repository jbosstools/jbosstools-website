== Maven support updated to M2E 1.9.1

The Maven support is based on Eclipse M2E 1.9.1, bringing the following features:

=== Advanced classpath isolation
Thanks to Eclipse Photon, there are new two different classpathes, the main and the test classpath.
The main classes will now no longer see the test classes and dependencies

=== Embedded Maven runtime
The embedded Maven runtime is now based on Apache Maven 3.5.3.

=== Archetype catalog management
It is now possible to disable an archetype catalog.

=== Java 9/10 support
Support for Java 9/10 has been improved: bugs fixes, better handling of module path.
