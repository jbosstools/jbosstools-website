== New and improved JBoss Central page

This release includes a slick, http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/19689/is-new-and-improved-an-oxymoron[new and improved]
 JBoss Central. This is a HTML-based page designed to provide instant access to a large variety of JBoss Developer materials.
 From top to bottom, you have access to :

 * the latest news/blog posts about JBoss technologies, cycling in a carousel
 * a search engine for project examples, similar to the one in http://www.jboss.org/developer-materials/
 * links to:
 ** the software updates page, where you can install new Eclipse features that have been tested to work with JBoss Tools
 ** the http://www.jboss.org/developer-materials/ website
 ** the http://tools.jboss.org/cat/[Community Acceptance testing] page, where you can help us make JBoss Tools better
 * Finally, the lowest section displays common wizards and the list of recently used examples, helping you to start new projects quickly and easily

We are really proud of how the new JBoss Central page gracefully adapts to lower resolutions, thanks to the http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap framework] under the hood. We really hope you'll appreciate it as well.
Please don't hesitate to provide your feedback.
