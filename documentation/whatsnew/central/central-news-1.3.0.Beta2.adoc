== New Hybrid Mobile project wizard 	

JBoss Central now features the Hybrid Mobile Project wizard to let you kickstart new Cordova-based mobile applications.

If the Hybrid Mobile Toolkit is not installed, you'll be asked to install it, as well as a few useful companion features (CordovaSim, BrowserSim). When using JBoss Tools you'll also be offered to add LiveReload and the Visual Plugin Editor, if these features are not already installed. 

The Spring Project wizard, that was previously featured on JBoss Central, is still available in the File > New > Project... menu.

== Early Access

We introduced the concept of 'Early Access' features that can be installed from 'Software/Updates' tab of Central page. These Early Access features
are usually experimental or still being developed, so they may contains bugs and may not yet behave correctly.

To support these new incubating feature, we've updated the Central view.

=== Related UI changes

On the central view, you can now see a 'Show Early Access' checkbox. When selected, it enables you to install 'Early Access' features. You can
easily recognize them thanks to their yellow background and to their 'Early Access' label at the right of the description.

This Early Access features can be installed and uninstalled as regular features. Doing so will enable additional software sources from which these incubating features can be installed. Those additional sources may install unexpected feature when updating.
