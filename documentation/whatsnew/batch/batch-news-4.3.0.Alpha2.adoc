== Searching and Renaming Batch Artifacts 

Search for references (Ctrl+Shift+G) works for batch artifact classes and its property fields. For example if you have a batchlet class: 
----
@Named
public class SearchableBatchlet implements Batchlet {

	@Inject @BatchProperty(name="secondName") String otherName;
...
}
----
then results for SearchableBatchlet references will include the corresponding Job XML file:

When you rename some class name or property field then the corresponding Job XML references will be renamed too:
