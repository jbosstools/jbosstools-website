== Batch Job XML Editor

A new JavaEE 7 Batch job XML editor is available in JBoss Tools 4.3. The editor has three tabs:

- Tree form editor
- Visual (diagram) editor
- XML source editor

=== Visual (diagram) editor features

* Visualization of structure of batch job, i.e.:
** step, flow, split, decision
** connection using next attribute and next elements
** end, stop and fail outcomes
** support for browsing nested flows
* Other properties editable via context actions and linked property views
* Setting a flow element as a start (i.e. reordering)
* Content proposal for batch artifacts

See a demo video:

=== Content Assist

Job XML Editor provides content assist for <* ref="">, <* next="">, <* to="">, <* restart=""> and for batch properties:

Content assist also works for any _class_ attribute (used to reference exception classes). Just type the first letter of the class or name and the content assist will show all available proposals.

=== Hyperlink navigation (OpenOns)

Batch artifacts can be navigated to via OpenOn. Just press Ctrl and click on <* ref="">, <* next="">, <* to="">, <* restart=""> or property name to open the corresponding source code or Job XML element.

To navigate from the Properties editor to the corresponding batch artifact, click the icon at the property name and select 'Open <artifact>'.

If no artifacts are included, click the 'Create <artifact>' link. This starts the 'New Batch Artifact' wizard.

It is also possible to navigate (Ctrl+Click) from injection points annotated @BatchProperty to the corresponding property references:

== Validation

Batch artifact and property references are validated in Job XML files:

related_jira::JBIDE-19158[]

There are Quick Fixes available for the following validation problems:

- "Batchlet "<batchlet-name>" is not found"
- "Checkpoint algorithm "<checkpointalgorithm-name>" is not found"
- "Decider "<decider-name>" is not found"
- "Item Processor "<itemprocessor-name>" is not found"
- "Item Reader "<itemreader-name>" is not found"
- "Item Writer "<itemwriter-name>" is not found"
- "Job listener "<joblistener-name>" is not found"
- "Partition Analyzer "<partitionanalyzer-name>" is not found"
- "Partition Collector "<partitioncollector-name>" is not found"
- "Partition Mapper "<partitionmapper-name>" is not found"
- "Partition Reducer "<partitionreducer-name>" is not found"
- "Step listener "<steplistener-name>" is not found"

The Quick Fixes open a pre-set New Batch Artifact wizard to create the missing artifact:

== Searching and Renaming Batch Artifacts

Search for references (Ctrl+Shift+G) works for batch artifact classes and its property fields. For example if you have a batchlet class:
----
@Named
public class SearchableBatchlet implements Batchlet {

	@Inject @BatchProperty(name="secondName") String otherName;
...
}
----
then results for SearchableBatchlet references will include the corresponding Job XML file:

When you rename some class name or property field then the corresponding Job XML references will be renamed too:

== New Batch Job XML Wizard

New Batch Job XML wizard is available in New->Others->Batch menu and creates a new Batch Job XML file:

== New Batch Artifact wizard

This wizard allows to create batch artifacts, such as:

* Batchlet
* Checkpoint Algorithm
* Decider
* Item Reader
* Item Writer
* Item Processor
* Partition Analyzer
* Partition Reducer
* Partition Collector
* Partition Mapper
* Partition Plan
* Chunk Listener
* Item Process Listener
* Item Reader Listener
* Item Writer Listener
* Job Listener
* Step Listener
* Retry Process Listener
* Retry Read Listener
* Retry Write Listener
* Skip Process Listener
* Skip Listener
* Skip Write Listener.

== Performance improvements

We have fixed a critical performance issue with JBoss Knowledge Base builder for project with large JAR libraries that contain Batch artifacts.
For example, if your Maven project has a dependency on glassfish-embedded-all.jar then it could take more than 5 minutes to build the project just because of this dependency. Now, it takes seconds.
