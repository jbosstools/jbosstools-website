== Camel URI completion with XML DSL

As announced link:https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/01/31/apache-camel-uri-completion-eclipse-xml-editor/[here], it was already possible to have Camel URI completion with XML DSL in the source tab of the Camel Route editor by installing the link:https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-eclipse[Language Support for Apache Camel] in your IDE.

This feature is now installed by default with Fuse Tooling!

Now you have the choice to use the properties view with UI help to configure Camel components or to use the source editor and benefit from completion features. It all depends on your development preferences!
