== Bean Support

We are happy to finally announce support for *Beans* (Spring / Blueprint).

Using the Route Editor you can now access Spring / Blueprint Beans in your Camel Context through the *Configurations* tab.

In the *Configurations* tab you can see all global configuration elements of your Camel Context. You can ``Add``, ``Edit`` and ``Delete`` elements using the buttons on the right side.

By clicking the ``Add`` or ``Edit`` button a wizard will be opened to guide you on the creation of the Bean.

In the wizard you can select an existing bean class from your project or create a new bean class. You can also specify constructor arguments and bean properties.
Once created you can then modify the properties of that Bean inside the ``Properties`` view.
