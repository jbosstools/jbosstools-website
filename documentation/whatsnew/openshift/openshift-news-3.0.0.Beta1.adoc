== Import to an Eclipse project
An OpenShift v3 application can now be imported into Eclipse using JBoss Tools.
The import wizard prompts you to select a build config which contains the URI of your source repository.
The wizard clones the source repository and imports the code into your Eclipse workspace as an Eclipse project.

All source repositories are imported as general Eclipse projects that you can manually configure to match your needs, except
those which utilize Maven.  Maven is recognized by the import process and the Eclipse projects are enabled via Eclipse's Maven support.
Eclipse project type detection will be improved in upcoming releases via the new Eclipse https://wiki.eclipse.org/E4/UI/Smart_Import["Smart Import"] facility.
