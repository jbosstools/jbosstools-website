== OpenShift 3 support improvements

More than 60 issues have been fixed in this release of the OpenShift tooling, targeting OpenShift 3 support.
The OpenShift 3 integration was introduced as a techpreview feature in JBDS 9.0.0.GA but will graduate to a supported feature in the upcoming JBDS 9.1.0.GA release.
Here's a selection of the most interesting fixes and improvements we brought here:

=== OpenShift 3 server adapter improvements

[NOTE]
This feature requires the OpenShift binary version 1.1.1 or higher. You can download the binary matching your OS from the https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[official release page on github.com]

A few improvements have been made to the OpenShift 3 server adapter introduced in the last milestone release:

==== Support for incremental publishing
The OpenShift 3 server adapter now respects the auto-publish settings as declared in the server editor,
giving the user the option to automatically publish on workspace changes,
build events, or only when the user requests it.
The server adapter is also able to incrementally deploy the server's
associated project with a speedy call to rsync, ensuring minimal over-the-wire
transfers and a fast turnaround for testing your project.

==== Support for Java EE projects
Experimental support for Java EE projects (Web and EAR) has been introduced.
When the workspace project associated with the OpenShift 3 server is a Dynamic
or Enterprise Application project,
the server adapter will build an exploded version of the archive to a local,
temporary directory and will replace the version deployed on the remote OpenShift
pod. That `Pod Deployment Path`, is now inferred automatically from the imagestream tags on the remote Pod.
A `.dodeploy` marker file will be created for the remote server to redeploy the module, if necessary (for EAP/WildFly servers supporting it).

Since this is an experimental feature, there are a few caveats, obviously:

- currently, incremental support for Java EE project only applies to static resources (web pages, javascript, css, images...).
- Java classes are not reloaded (it would require enabling debug mode on the remote server).
- locally deleted files are not deleted remotely (it would break other deployment use cases)

Rest assured we will try to overcome these shortcomings in the future.

==== Support for LiveReload
We have enabled link:/features/livereload.html[LiveReload] support for OpenShift 3 server adapters.
Accessible from the `Show In > Web Browser via LiveReload Server` menu,
every time a file is published to the server adapter, the Browser connected
to the LiveReload server instance will refresh automatically.

This is particularly effective in conjunction with the Auto Publish mode now
accessible for the OpenShift 3 server adapters, as all it takes to reload a web
resource is saving the file under edition (Ctrl+S, or Cmd+S on Mac).

=== OpenShift Explorer improvements
==== Simplified view for OpenShift 3 resources
We thought the previous OpenShift 3 resources representation tended to expose to much of OpenShift's gritty details.
The explorer view has been now been greatly simplified (and made much more robust) and allows you to focus on an application-centric view.

Under an OpenShift 3 connection, can live multiple OpenShift projects. Under each project, application deployments,
each associated with one service, are displayed.
Next to the service name is the default route, when relevant.
It can be conveniently opened from the `Show In > Web Browser` menu.

Under a service deployment node will be displayed running Pods and/or Builds in progress.

So what happened to the rest of the OpenShift resources?
Simple: everything that is not displayed directly under the OpenShift Explorer
is accessible in the Properties view.
Opened via the `Properties` menu in the OpenShift Explorer (or `Ctrl+I`, `Cmd+I` on Mac), the Properties view is
dynamically linked to any selected resource in the workspace.
When selecting a Project or Service, it displays a series of tabs, each matching a set of OpenShift
resources linked to the one selected in the OpenShift Explorer.
In each tab, you can edit or delete a resource, open it in the Web Console or access more
specific options via a right-click.

The Properties view is dynamically bound to server side events,
so it refreshes itself automatically whenever a resource change has occurred.

=== Red Hat Container Development Kit server adapter

The Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) server adapter now provides menus to quickly access the Docker Explorer and the OpenShift Explorer.
Right-click on a running CDK server adapter and select an option in the `Show In` menu:
