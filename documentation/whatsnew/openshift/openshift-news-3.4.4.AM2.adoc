=== Enhanced Spring Boot support for server adapter

Spring Boot runtime was already supported by the OpenShift server adapter. However, it has one major limitation: files and
resources were synchronized between the local workstation and the remote pod(s) only for the main project. If your Spring Boot
application had dependencies that were present in the local workspace, any change to a file or resource of one of these dependencies
was not handled. This is not true anymore.
