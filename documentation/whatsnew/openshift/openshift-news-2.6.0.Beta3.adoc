== Edit domain members 
OpenShift allows you to add and remove other users to your domain and grant them view or write permissions. 
In JBoss Tools 4.2.0.Beta3 we added a link to the domain wizard. Hitting this link points your browser to the webpage in the OpenShift where you can manage your domain members.

== Choose the local changes that you want to publishing to OpenShift

JBoss Tools 4.2.0.Beta3 now allows you to pick the files that you want to publish. Once you tell the OpenShift server adapter to publish, it checks the pending changes and lists them in a dialog. 
You may then stage the ones you want to push and provide a commit message. +
The very same is true for the inital import of your OpenShift application: 
The application-/import-wizard lists the files it changed and allows you to commit and push them back to OpenShift.
