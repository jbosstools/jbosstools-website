=== Pipeline builds support

Pipeline based builds are now supported by the OpenShift tooling. 
When creating an application, if using a template, if one of the builds is based on pipeline, you can view the detail
of the pipeline:

When your application is deployed, you can see the details of the build configuration for the pipeline based builds:
