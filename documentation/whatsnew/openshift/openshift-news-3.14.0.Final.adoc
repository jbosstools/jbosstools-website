=== Login to Developer Sandbox from the tooling

Red Hat provides an online OpenShift environment called 
https://red.ht/dev-sandbox[Developer Sandbox] that makes it easy for developers to build, test and deploy cloud
native applications and microservices.

In order to use Developer Sandbox, you must own a Red Hat SSO account (which can be linked to social accounts like
GitHub,...). Once logged in into Red Hat SSO, you will get an environment provisioned in Developer Sandbox but
the first time you will try to login in to Developer Sandbox, your account needs to be verified (in order to
prevent crypto miners and robots) thus you need to go through a verification phase where you will be asked to provide:

- first your phone number and country code
- then a verification code that you will receive on your smartphone.

So it is now possible to provision and log in to Developer Sandbox from the OpenShift tooling and connect it to the Developer Sandbox environment.

Open the `OpenShift Application Explorer` view (`Window -> Show View -> Other...`, enter `open` and double click on `OpenShift Application Explorer`):

Please note that the `URL` and `Token` fields have been updated. Click the `Finish` button, the `OpenShift Application Explorer` will be updated with the Developer
Sandbox URL and if you expand it, you will see 3 namespaces/projects available for you to start playing with:
