=== OpenShift Container Platform 4 support

With the new OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 now available (see this 
https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-redefines-enterprise-kubernetes-through-full-stack-automation-red-hat-openshift-4?source=pressreleaselisting[article,window=_blank]),
even if this is a major shift compared to OCP 3, JBoss Tools is compatible with
this major release in a transparent way. Just define your connection to your
OCP 4 based cluster as you did before for an OCP 3 cluster, and use the tooling !
