=== Node.js Debugger 

Now it is possible to debug Node.js applications deployed to Openshift. All you need to do is creating a *Server Adapter* for the app and running it in the *Debug* mode. After that a new *V8* debug session will be created:

Put some breakpoints in the code and start debugging!

Changing the code during the debug session is also supported - just save the file and new changes will be applied automatically. Here is a short demo video which describes the debugging process in action:
