== Application wizard
=== Downloadable Cartridges and all new UX

Starting with JBoss Tools 4.2.0 Beta1 we overhauled the application wizard that was becoming pretty crowded. +

We also introduced support for downloadable cartridges. Downloadable cartridges in OpenShift allow you to hand OpenShift your own framework via a git repository url.
Your cartridge code may run as web- (standalone) or add-on-cartridge (embedded cartridge). JBoss Tools supports both breeds.

==== New Application wizard

If you now launch the OpenShift application wizard you will first get to chose whether you want to import your existing application or create a new one. +

===== Import an Existing Application

Import your existing application is as easy as picking it from the list of all your OpenShift applications. 
You may freely type it's name and get content assisted when typing. 
Alternatively you may hit browse and choose among your applications across all your domains. +

===== Create a New Application

When creating a new application you will have to choose the application type (cartridge) up-front. 
You may choose among the predefined cartridges that are shipped with your OpenShift server.
Alternatively you may also decide to provide your own framework code via the url of your git repository ("Code Anything").

The next wizard page then allows you to configure all application details such as the name, domain, gear and the add-on (embeddable) cartridges.

At this stage you eventually want to add embeddable cartridges. Here again you may choose among the predefined ones or provide your own cartridge code.
