== New examples from developer.jboss.org

As mentioned in link:4.3.0.Beta1.html#central[the JBoss Central section], the JBoss Central page now provides over 200 project examples.

However, these examples are not yet integrated in the Project Examples wizard, nor completely supported
by the Offline support mechanism:
After running an example once, it will be available even if your internet connection goes down, but the groovy script in `Preferences > JBoss Tools > Project Examples > Offline Support` will not fetch and cache these new examples.

These issues will be addressed in the next Beta release.
