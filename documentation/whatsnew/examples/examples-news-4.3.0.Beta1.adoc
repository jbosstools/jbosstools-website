== New examples from developer.jboss.org

As mentioned in link:4.3.0.Beta1.html#central[the JBoss Central section], you now have access to more than 200 project
 examples from the Central page.

However, please note these examples are not integrated yet in the Project Examples wizard, nor completely supported
by the Offline support mechanism:
after you run an example once, it will be available even if your internet connection goes down, however,
the groovy script in `Preferences > JBoss Tools > Project Examples > Offline Support` will not fetch and
cache these new examples.

We plan to address these issues in the next Beta release.
