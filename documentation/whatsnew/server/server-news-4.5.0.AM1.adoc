== EAP 7.1 Server Adapter

A server adapter has been added to work with EAP 7.1. It's currently released in Tech-Preview mode only, since the underlying WildFly 11 continues to be under active development with substantial opportunity for breaking changes. This new server adapter includes support for incremental management deployment like it's upstream WildFly 11 counterpart.
