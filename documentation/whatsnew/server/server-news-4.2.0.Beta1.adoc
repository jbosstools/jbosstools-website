== JBoss Server Adapters


=== Deployment over management

AS 7, EAP 6 and WildFly server adapters now support deploying over management as opposed to the file management api.

The advantage of deployment over management is that you can do this with local and remote servers without having direct access to the filesystem (you of course need to have access to the management api).

The disadvantage compared to file based deployment is that you cannot do incremental updates, it has to be full deployments. Thus if you have large deployments or want to update files incrementally the local/file based deployment is to be preffered. 

=== Optional runtimes for remote servers

Servers configured as remote no longer require a runtime locally installed. Allowing you to do deployments/queries remotely.

Adding a local runtime to your server helps with finding things like default ports, and may be required for proper functioning of some lesser-used functionality like the JMX explorer, but for most operations, a remote 
server no longer requires a local runtime to be present. 

Whether or not a profile requires a runtime is determined by how that profile functions. 
Servers configured for local use always (currently) require a local runtime, while remote servers
don't anymore.

=== Profiles

All the server adapters for JBoss AS, WildFly and EAP now has a notion of profiles.

A profile is a set of functionality and pre-configured options that help you decide how you want
to run your server and what types of actions it should take for all the different types of functionality. 

While earlier server adapters still only have two such profiles (local and remote servers), any server
adapter based on JBoss AS 7 or later will have two additional options, specifically whether or not
to prefer using "Management" operations instead of filesystem operations. 

A server set in a profile preferring management operations will connect to the server's management service
to perform actions such as shutdown, deployment, and determining the state of the server. A server not
preferring management operations will continue to, for example, run a shutdown command over ssh to terminate
the server, or send files over ssh to your remote server's deployment folder.

Above, you can see how to select the profile you want to use. 
When you select a profile you will get another page asking for the details needed for that profile. The image below shows how that looks for a remote server.

== Deploy-Only server

=== Profiles

Deploy Only server now supports two profiles: local and remote. Local is similar to how it worked
before (deploy files locally) and remote is adding support for deploying via Eclipse RSE system (such
as secure copy over SSH).

The first step of the New Server wizard is to select either one or the other of these profiles.

When configuring the server for local use, a deploy folder and a temporary deploy
folder are required.

When configuring the server for remote use, you'll be asked to also provide a hostname 
for the server.

=== Start and Stop Scripts

The Deploy-Only server now allow optional start and stop scripts which are used when launching and stopping the server.

Previously Deploy-Only just assumed the server was started, now you can tell it to actually do a start and stop command.

By default there are no start and stop commands available.

If you toggle the "Server is externally managed" you will be able to
specify commands for start and stop.

When attempting to shut down your server, the command you've entered will be executed on 
the local or remote system. If the shutdown command fails, though, the Deploy-Only server will attempt
to kill the process that was used to launch the server. Users configuring the Deploy-Only server to run
the launch or shutdown scripts that wrap a java command (such as JBoss AS, EAP and WildFly) terminating these scripts may not actually terminate the backing java command.
