== Support for Port Monitoring

Support for Port Monitoring has been (finally) added to JBoss, WildFly, and our enterprise server adapters. With a preference page, a view for tracking recent past requests, integration with the servers view, and some custom enhancements of our own, JBoss Tools is confident that our integration with this WebTools feature is more complete than what's available with other server adapters.

== Launch Bar

A new feature hiding in the CDT repository of eclipse is being released with Mars. Called the Launch Bar, this feature aims to update the UI of eclipse to allow for more easy running of launch configurations (and other things). In this Beta1 release, we're adding this feature in an optional addition to our Server Tools. We've also written our own extensions to it, integrating the Launch Bar with WTP's Server Adapters.

The list of launchable objects (center) is linked with your selections in the workspace when used with our extensions, in most cases before you've ever even launched the object. The list of targets (on the right) will include all existing server adapters compatible with the launchable. 

For more information, you can also check launchbar's link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/LaunchBar[documentation] at eclipse.org, or try it for yourself.
