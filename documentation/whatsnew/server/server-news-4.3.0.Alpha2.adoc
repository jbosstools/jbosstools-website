== Experimental support added for the WildFly 9 Application Server Distribution

New server adapter and runtime types have been created for WildFly 9. While we believe these adapters are feature-complete currently, they've been marked 'experimental' because the upstream project is not yet released in its Final form, and could change in ways that break our support between their milestones. 

Behavior and workflows of the new server and runtime types mirror those of previous WildFly adapters, and should operate smoothly with all existing workflows. If a lack tooling support was holding you back from playing with WildFly 9 to see if it works for your usecases, you'll be happy to hear that your roadblock has just been removed. 

This support is currently only added for the "Application Server Distribution" and not the "Servlet-Only Distribution".
