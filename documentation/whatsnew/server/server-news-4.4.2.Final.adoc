== Support for Jolokia JMX Connections

For some users, accessing a remote test server via standard JMX may require opening ports that, for one reason or another, cannot be opened. In these cases, a user may choose to deploy a jolokia agent to their server. Jolokia is a deployable war archive that exposes JMX over http, typically using JSON. This feature is handy as an added tool for debugging a development application, but is not really suitable or safe to expose on production. With that in mind, the workflow is as follows:

1) Download the Jolokia war file from jolokia.org, and place it in the proper deployments folder for your application server. For wildfly, this folder is 'standalone/deployments'

2) Start your server via whatever method you typically use. If your usecase allows it, use the Servers view to create and start a server adapter. If this workflow doesn't work for you, you may wish to start the server manually. 

3) Once your server is started, open the JMX Navigator

4) Right click on the "User-Defined Connections" item, and select 'New Connection'

5) Select 'Jolokia Connection'

6) Give the connection a name, and the url at which jolokia can be reached. Then finish the wizard

7) Now you can browse your JMX tree in the JMX Navigator!

Most other JMX operations will work. You can double-click an MBean node to open the editor, check properties, or invoke operations. Notifications, however, are not supported.
