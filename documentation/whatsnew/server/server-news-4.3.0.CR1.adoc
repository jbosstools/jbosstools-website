== WildFly 10, and EAP 7 Server Adapters have been added!

While there's not much to really go into here, new server adapters for JBoss EAP 7 and WildFly 10 have been added to the toolset, allowing you to enjoy all the past benefits, but with all the newest runtimes.

== Support for Java 9 jigsaw builds in WildFly 10

After a few small tweaks, we've now verified that WildFly can be run on the newest builds of Java 9 with Jigsaw. This support is only built into our WildFly 10 adapters by default, but users of earlier application servers can remove the `-jaxpmodule javax.xml.jaxp-provider` portion of the launch arguments to get the same support.
