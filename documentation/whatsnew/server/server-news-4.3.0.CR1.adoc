== Support for Java 9 Jigsaw builds in WildFly 10

We have now verified that WildFly can be run on the newest builds of Java 9 with Jigsaw. This support is only built into our WildFly 10 adapters by default, but users of earlier application servers can remove the `-jaxpmodule javax.xml.jaxp-provider` portion of the launch arguments to get the same support.
