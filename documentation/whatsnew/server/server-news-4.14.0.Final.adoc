== EAP 4.3 and 5.0 Server Adapters deprecated

As Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Server 4.3 and 5.0 are now end of life, we have
deprecate their corresponding adapters. You will see a new `End of life` label when
trying to create a server adapter based on  those runtimes. We don't plan any
maintenance anymore and they may be removed in the future.
