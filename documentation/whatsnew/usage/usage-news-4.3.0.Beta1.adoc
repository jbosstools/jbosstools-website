== Browser Usage

The SWT Browser name and version is now collected for usage statistics to help the JBoss Tools team to learn more about preferred user configurations.

All collected information is reflected in `Preferences > JBoss Tools > Usage Reporting` for the user's review.

As always, JBoss Tools does not send any information unless a user has opted into this option, nor is there ever any personal information sent.
