== Usage tracking for wizards, Forge Tools, HTML Editor, Cordovasim, Browsersim

A few new usage events have been added to this beta/milestone release:
 
- Number of times JBoss Tools HTML/JSP Editor (Source/Visual tab) and HTML5 Preview are activated
- Class name of completed IDE wizards 
- BrowserSim and CordovaSim engine names (JavaFx or Webkit) and number of times started
- Forge Tools runtime version and number of times started

These will be used to learn more about how our users are using the tooling and improve it going forward. 

All information which is going to be collected is reflected in Preferences > JBoss Tools > Usage Reporting for you to review.

As always JBoss Tools will not send any information before a user have opted in, nor is there any personal information sent.
