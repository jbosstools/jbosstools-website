== New Back-end usage

We changed the backend system used in the usage bundle from Google Analytocs to Segment. This as no impact on how we collected usage inforamtion, neither change the opt-in choice made in previous version of JBossTools.

As always, neither Eclipse nor JBoss will use any information unless a user has opted in, nor is there ever any personal information sent unless it is provided on the Preferences page.
