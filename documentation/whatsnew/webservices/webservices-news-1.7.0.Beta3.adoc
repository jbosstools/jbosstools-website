== As-you-type Validation

As-you-type validation occurs in the scope of the java element (type declaration or method) that is being edited. If the java element corresponds to a JAX-RS element, this later is validated. 
Note that as opposed to "cascade validation" (see below) that occurs when the underlying file is saved, the related JAX-RS elements are not validated "as-you-type", in order to keep the process as fast as possible.

== Validating JAX-RS elements in cascade

When fixing problems in a class, all related JAX-RS elements are included in the set of classes of to be validated, which means that related problems can end up being resolved.

For example, let's assume that a user has the following classes:

[source,java]
----
public class Car {
	
	public Car fromString(String value) {
		return ...;
	}

}
----

and

[source,java]
----
@Path("/cars")
public class CarResource

  @POST 
  public Response createCar(Car car) { 
    ...
  }
} 
----

In this example, the JAX-RS validator will report a problem on the +CarResource#create(Car)+ method because the +Car+ class is not a valid parameter: the +Car#fromString(String)+ method should actually be static. When the user adds the missing static modifier on the +Car#fromString(String)+ method and saves the file, not only the +Car+ class will be validated, but also the +CarResource+, and at the end of the day, the problem reported earlier will be resolved.

== Support for Resource Fields, Resource Properties and Parameter Aggregators 

JAX-RS Resource Fields and Properties (ie, fields or setter methods annotated with +@PathParam+, +@QueryParam+, +@MatrixParam+), as well as  the JAX-RS 2.0 Parameter Aggregators (ie, method parameters, fields or setter methods annotated with +@BeanParam+) are recognized. 

These elements are taken into account when validating the project and when displaying the Endpoints URI templates in the Project explorer.

For example, let's assume that a user has the following class:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/cars")
public class CarResource {
	
	@MatrixParam("year")
	private String year;
	
	@QueryParam("color")
	private String color;
	
	@GET
	@Path("{id}") 
	public Response getCar(@PathParam("id") String id) {
		return ...;
	}
}
----

In that case, the Endpoint URI template associated with the Resource Method and displayed in the Project Explorer will be +/{id:String};year={String}?color={String}+

Now, if the user has the following classes:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/cars")
public class CarResource {
	
	@GET
	@Path("/{id}")
	public Response getCar(@PathParam("id") String id, @BeanParam OptionalParams options) {
		return null; 
	}
}
----

and

[source,java]
----
public class OptionalParams {

	@QueryParam("color")
	public String color;
	
	private String year;

	public String getYear() {
		return year;
	}

	@MatrixParam("year")
	public void setYear(String year) {
		this.year = year;
	}
	
}
----

then the Endpoint URI template associated with the Resource Method (and its associated Parameter Aggregator) and displayed in the Project Explorer will also be +/cars/{id:String};year={String}?color={String}+

In this second example, it is the +@BeanParam+ annotation on the method parameter that is used to link to the Parameter Aggregator.
