== Hybrid Mobile (Cordova) Tools
=== Search and use Cordova engines from local file system

Hybrid Mobile tools can search and use Cordova engines from local directories. This permits custom Cordova engines to be used together with the tools.
At this time only custom engines that adhere to the file and naming structure of Apache Cordova distributions will be recognized by the tools.

A preference is added for selecting a default engine. Default engines are used when a configured engine for a project is removed and on the new project wizard
to pre-select the engine. See above for a screen shot for the new preference node.
