=== Restore Cordova plugins during import

On importing Cordova projects to the IDE, *registry* plug-ins referenced in the project _config.xml_ files are automatically restored. This makes sharing Cordova projects within teams possible without adding plug-ins to a source control system. Additionally, project _config.xml_ files are updated when plug-ins are added or removed from projects using the IDE Install and Remove Cordova Plug-in tools so you can be confident that the _config.xml_ files contains up to date plug-in information.

See http://www.gorkem-ercan.com/2014/06/sharing-cordova-projects-becomes-easier.html[Gorkem's post] for
a demo of the feature.
