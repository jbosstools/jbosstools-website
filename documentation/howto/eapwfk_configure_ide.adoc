This article provides details for new and existing users who need to configure a fresh install of the IDE or upgrade the versions of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or JBoss Web Framework Kit in use.

The IDE supports application development and deployment with JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit only after you configure the IDE for use with JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit. This configuration is essential for using the enterprise versions of the example Maven projects provided in JBoss Central. These projects are intended for deployment to JBoss EAP and necessitate IDE access to the JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories.

Instructions are provided for the following tasks:

. <<SetUpJBossEAP, Set up JBoss EAP>> for use in the IDE in one of three different ways

. <<ConfigureMaven, Configure Maven for JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories>>

[[SetUpJBossEAP]]
== 1. Set Up JBoss EAP
To set up JBoss EAP for use in the IDE, you must direct the IDE to the local or remote runtime servers. This establishes a communication channel between the IDE and the JBoss EAP server for efficient deployment and server management workflows.
Depending on your circumstance, you can set up the JBoss EAP server in one of three ways:

A. If you are installing a new instance of the IDE, you can use Red Hat Development Suite to download, install, and set up the IDE and JBoss EAP. 

B. If you already have the IDE installed but not JBoss EAP, you can <<FromWithinJBDS, download, install, and set up JBoss EAP from within the IDE>>.

C. If the IDE and JBoss EAP are already installed, you can <<UseRuntimeDetection, use runtime detection to set up JBoss EAP from within the IDE>>.

[[Using_devsuite]]
=== A Downloading, Installing, and Setting Up the IDE and JBoss EAP using the DevSuite Installer

If you are installing a new instance of the IDE, you can use the Red Hat Development Suite Installer to download, install, and set up the IDE and JBoss EAP. A specific JBoss EAP version is packaged in the installer. For details of the components installed through Red Hat Development Suite, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_development_suite/2.0/html/installation_guide/red_hat_development_suite_component_details[Component Details] in the _Red Hat Development Suite Installation Guide_.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to install a different version of JBoss EAP, you can either download it from within the IDE (see <<FromWithinJBDS, download, install, and set up JBoss EAP from within the IDE)>>) or install it separately and then follow the instructions in C, <<UseRuntimeDetection,use runtime detection to set up JBoss EAP from within the IDE>>.

[[UseRuntimeDetection]]
=== C. Use Runtime Detection to Set Up JBoss EAP from within the IDE

If the IDE and JBoss EAP are already installed, you can use runtime detection to set up JBoss EAP from within the IDE. The runtime detection feature automatically identifies the JBoss EAP instance installed on your local system and generates a corresponding default server setup for use in the IDE. This feature makes getting started with a default JBoss EAP server very quick.

[NOTE]
====
Specific JBoss EAP versions are supported by each IDE release; for details of supported JBoss EAP versions see `https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/427493`.
====

To use runtime detection to set up JBoss EAP for use in the IDE:

. Start the IDE.

. Click *Window* > *Preferences*, expand *JBoss Tools*, and then select *JBoss Runtime Detection*.

. Click *Add*.

. Navigate to `path/to/jboss-eap` and click *OK*. JBoss Server Tools recursively scans the path searching for installed servers and displays a list of those it finds.

. Ensure the *jboss-eap-version* check box is selected, where version denotes the JBoss EAP version, and click *OK*.
+
.Selecting a Runtime
image::eapwfk_jbosseap_version_selected.png[Selecting a Runtime]
+
. Click *Apply* and click *OK* to close the *Preferences* window.

*Result:* The server is listed in the *Servers* view in the *Stopped* mode.

[[ConfigureMaven]]
== 2. Configure Maven for JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven Repositories

To configure Maven to use the JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories when working inside the IDE, you must ensure that the IDE knows the location of your Maven configuration `settings.xml` file and that the necessary profiles for the JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories are contained in that file. This ensures that Maven knows where to search for project dependencies when it is called to build Maven projects from within the IDE.

[[SpecifyRepositoriesLocation]]
=== Specify Maven settings.xml File Location

If you have multiple Maven `settings.xml` files or you are using a shared `settings.xml` file, then this file may not be in the default location expected by the IDE. In this case, you must inform the IDE of the file location.

To specify the Maven `settings.xml` file location:

. Start the IDE.

. Click *Window* > *Preferences*, expand *Maven*, and then click *User Settings*.

. For the *User Settings* field, click *Browse* and locate the `settings.xml` file.

. Click *Update Settings*.

. Click *Apply* and then click *OK*.

[[UseRepositories]]
=== Use JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven Repositories

You can either download the JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories from the Red Hat Customer Portal or use the online Maven repository located at `https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga`.

[[UseOfflineRepo]]
==== Use the Offline Maven Repositories

If you have not previously used these versions of JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit, you must configure your Maven `settings.xml` file to use the associated product Maven repositories. You can manually edit your `settings.xml` file in a text editor or use the JBoss Developer Studio Maven integration feature to automatically detect the JBoss repositories and appropriately edit your `settings.xml` file.

[NOTE]
====
The JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories must be already obtained from the Red Hat Customer Portal and located on a system that you can access.
====

To specify the JBoss EAP and JBoss Web Framework Kit Maven repositories locations using the IDE:

. Start the IDE.
