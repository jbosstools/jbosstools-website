== Did You Know

== Troubleshooting

=== Git Communication Error

.Git Communication Error
image::fh_git_communication_error.png[Git Communication Error]

*Error Message*

Problem when cloning the application. This can be due to a network problem or missing security credentials. Refer to error log for details.

**Issue**

When a FeedHenry account is set up, the user’s API Keys are configured by default, but the SSH Public key must be manually configured. Importing a FeedHenry application means that the application repository is accessed via Git. Without a Public SSH key, the tools are unable to complete the action and this error appears.

*Resolution*

. Click `OK` to close the `Git Communication Error` window.
. Log into FeedHenry at: `https://_[your-studio-domain]_.feedhenry.com`.
. Click the icon located in the uppermost right-side corner of the screen to display the context menu.
. Click `Settings` > `SSH Key Management` and then click `Add New Key`.
. In the `Public Key` field, enter your SSH Public key. An existing Public SSH key is available at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Alternatively, generate a new Public SSH key with the following command:
[source]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username@example.com"
----


=== Invalid Preferences

.Invalid Preferences
image::fh_invalid_preferences_error.png[Invalid Preferences]

*Issue*

When the user logs into FeedHenry for the first time, the `Invalid Preferences` dialog box appears informing the user that the FeedHenry connection preferences are unidentified or invalid and that the user must correct the preferences. Refer to the <<set_preferencess,Set the Preferences>> section for details to set the connection preferences.
