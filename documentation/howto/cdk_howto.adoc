[[about]]
== About Using the Container Development Kit with the IDE

Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) is a pre-built container development environment based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to help you get started developing container-based applications quickly.

There are two ways to install the Red Hat Container Development Kit with JBoss Developer Studio:

. Installation and configuration in one of two ways:
.. <<automatic,Automatically install and configure>> the Container Development Kit and the IDE using the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio Platform Installer.
.. <<manual,Manually download, install, and configure>> the Container Development Kit and the IDE.
. Use the installed components with the <<docker_tool,Docker Tooling>>.

[[automatic]]
== Automatic Installation and Configuration

Use the Red Hat Development Suite Installer to install the Container Development Kit, JBoss Developer Studio, and other relevant components. The Installer automatically configures these components for use together. This option is currently in Technical Preview and only available for Windows.

For instructions about using the Red Hat Development Suite Installer, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/2360571

After using the Red Hat Development Suite Installer to install Red Hat Container Development Kit and Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, manually run the Container Development Environment tooling, which also creates an OpenShift connection. Refer to the <<troubleshooting,Troubleshooting>> section for the workaround to a potential issue when starting the Container Development Kit tooling.

[[manual]]
== Manual Installation and Configuration

Manually download and install the Red Hat Container Development Kit and the IDE separately. This option requires some additional configuration steps before the two can be used together.

[[prereq]]
=== Prerequisites

Ensure that the following are installed on your system:

* A virtualization system such as VirtualBox, VMWare, or Linux KVM/libvirt.
* Vagrant, which is an open source tool to create and distribute portable development environments.
* Red Hat Container Development Kit 2.1
* Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 10

For details about installing these prerequisites, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-container-development-kit/2.1/installation-guide/[Red Hat Container Development Kit Installation Guide]


[[setupcdk]]
== Set Up the Container Development Kit in the IDE

To set up the Container Developement Kit in the IDE:

. Run the IDE.
. Press the **Ctrl+3** keys and in the **Quick Access** bar, type **Launch CDK**.
. From the results, click **Launch CDK Server**.
. In the **New Server** dialog box:
.. Ensure that the **Show downloadable server adapters** option is selected.
.. Add the desired **Server host name** in the relevant field.
.. Add the desired **Server Name** in the relevant field.
.. Click **Next** to continue.
+
.Define a New CDK Server
image::cdk_define_new_server.png[Define a New CDK Server]
+
. Add the security information and your **access.redhat.com** credentials:
.. Click **Add to add a new Username** for the Red Hat Customer Portal or select an existing user from the drop-down menu.
.. In the **Folder** field, navigate to the directory that contains your local **Vagrantfile** file. If **Vagrantfile** does not exist on your system, use the **Vagrantfiles** supplied in the **cdk.zip** file to initialize the CDK box.
.. Click **Finish** to conclude setting up the CDK Server Adapter.
+
.Define a New CDK Server Adapter
image::cdk_new_server_adapter.png[Define a New CDK Server Adapter]
+
. Run the Container Development Environment server.
. Add the OpenShift server.
. Test the OpenShift Console at https://10.1.2.2:8443 with the username **openshift-dev** and password **devel**.

You can now choose to continue working with OpenShift within JBoss Developer Studio or view instructions for Container-Based Development with JBoss Developer Studio.

[[docker_tool]]
== Docker Tooling

After starting the CDK server in the IDE, you can follow one of two container development workflows:

=== Using the Docker Tooling

Use Docker for Container-Based Development as follows:

. Create a new project with your **Dockerfile**.
.. Click **File** > **New** and select **Project**.
.. Type **java** in the search bar and from the results, select **Java Project** and click **Next** to continue.
.. Add a name for the new project and click **Finish**.
.. Click **File** > **New** and select **File**.
.. Enter the **Dockerfile** as the name and click **Finish**.
.. Edit the **Dockerfile** as desired and then save (for example, by creating a new Docker image to customize a given version of JBoss/WildFly by adding a datasource definition and its associated driver). The **Dockerfile** may also package your application as a **war** file via a Maven command, and copy it into the container in the WildFly deployments directory. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder for more information about the **Dockerfile** instructions.
. Do a Docker build using the Container Development Environment:
.. In the **Project Explorer**, right-click the **Dockerfile** and select **Run As** > **Docker Image Build**.
.. In the dialog box, for the **Connection** field, select your Container Development Environment server adapter.
.. For **Repository Name**, enter the desired name for the docker image and click **OK**.
.. Once the build is done, a new image with the given name will be listed in the **Docker Explorer** view and in the **Docker Images** view.
. Do a Docker run using the Container Development Environment:
.. Open the **Docker Explorer** view using the quick access menu using **Ctrl+3**.
.. Navigate to the **Images** node under the Docker connection.
.. Right-click your image and click **Run**.
.. Fill in the necessary details and click **Finish** to run your image.  It is optional to give the container a name, but it is recommended to name it. This name helps locate the specific container in a list of containers in the future.
. In the **Docker Explorer** view, select the container and expand its node and select the **8080** port and click on **Show In**>**Web browser** to access the application deployed in the Docker container.

=== Next Steps for the Docker Tooling

For further information about the basics of Docker Tooling, see link:docker_basics.html[Configure Docker Tooling (Basic)]

== OpenShift Tooling

=== Using OpenShift Tooling

Use OpenShift for Container-Based Development as follows:

. Create a new OpenShift project. OpenShift projects are like namespaces for OpenShift applications, which is different from how Eclipse projects relate to Eclipse applications. Additionally, Eclipse projects can be mapped to OpenShift applications.
.. If the installation was manual, you need to create an OpenShift 3 connection. In the **OpenShift Explorer** tab, click **New Connection Wizard** to create a new OpenShift 3 connection. If the Red Hat Development Suite Installer is used, this connection is automatically created when the Container Development Environment Tooling is run.
.. Add details for your connections, such as **Connection name**, **Server type**, **Server URL** and **Authentication** information.
.. Click **Finish** to create the connection.
.. The **OpenShift Explorer** tab now displays your new connection. Right-click the name of the connection and select **New** > **Project** to create a new OpenShift project.
.. Add the name and any other relevant details for your new OpenShift project and click **Finish**.
. Create an application in your OpenShift project using the OpenShift templates:
.. Right-click your new project’s name and click **New** > **Application**.
.. In the **Select Template** dialog box, type the application type required. For example, for a node.js application, type **nodejs** and from the displayed list, select **nodejs-example** and click **Finish**.
.. Click **OK** to accept the results of the application creation process.
.. When prompted, enter a new git location or click **Finish** in the dialog box to use the listed default git location for your application.
. Create a new OpenShift server adapter for your project and application:
.. In the **OpenShift Explorer** view, right-click the appropriate service under the relevant OpenShift Project.
.. In the **Select a server type** field, type **openshift**, and from the listed results, select **OpenShift 3 Server Adapter** and click **Next**.
.. In the displayed context menu, select **Server Adapter**. This displays a New Server wizard which has the adapter type and connection already selected.
.. Edit any of the settings as required, and then click **Finish**.
. Debug the application, if required.
.. In the **Server** view, from the context of a server adapter, select **Restart in Debug** to debug the application.

=== Next Steps for the OpenShift Tooling

See the link:./index.html#developing-apps-for-the-cloud-openshift-3[Developing for the Cloud with OpenShift 3] section in the index for additional tasks using the OpenShift 3 tooling.

[[known]]
== Known Issues

 * When the Docker Explorer is first started, attempting to extend the Containers or Images causes the explorer to fail and throw an exception. To work around this issue, restart Eclipse/JBoss Developer Studio. Details are in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-21983[JBIDE-21983]

 * When the Container Development Environment is first started, you can use the OpenShift Explorer as expected with the automatically created connection. However, if the Container Development Environment is stopped and started again, the OpenShift connection requests the OpenShift password because it did not save this information when the connection was created. The default password for this is *devel* and when asked, you can choose to save the password for future use. For details about this issue, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-2218[JBIDE-22186]

[[troubleshoot]]
== Troubleshooting

* After installation, starting the Container Development Kit using one of the custom Vagrantfiles with shared folders set up (`components/rhel/misc/shared_folder/rhel-ose/Vagrantfile` or `components/rhel/misc/shared_folder/rhel-k8s-singlenode-setup`) results in the server adapter displaying the `starting` message but never successfully starting the Container Development Environment tooling. For details about this issue, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-22604[JBIDE-22604]. The workaround for this issue is:

. Start Red Hat Container Development Kit with sshfs setup from the CLI:
+
----
$ cd components/rhel/misc/rhel-ose
$ vagrant up
----
+
. Set up the Container Development Environment tooling in JBoss Developer Studio and start it. Once this step is complete, the Container Development Environment tooling runs as expected.
