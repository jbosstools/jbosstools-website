== About Using the Container Development Kit with the IDE

Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) is a pre-built container development environment based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. CDK helps you get started with developing container-based applications quickly. You can easily set up CDK and then use toolings, such as, OpenShift Container Platform and Docker, through the IDE, without spending additional time in setting up and configuring the supplementary tooling.

Following are the two ways to install CDK with DevStudio: 

. <<using_devsuite>>
. <<seperate_products>>

Once installed, you can use the installed components with the Docker Tooling. 

[[using_devsuite]]
== Installing CDK and DevStudio Using the Red Hat Development Suite Installer

Use the Red Hat Development Suite (DevSuite) Installer to install CDK, DevStudio, and other relevant components. The Installer automatically configures these components for use together. This option is currently available for Windows, macOS, and RHEL 7. For instructions about using the DevSuite Installer, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_development_suite/1.4/html/installation_guide/[Red Hat Development Suite Installation Guide].

The installation configures CDK tooling (creates the CDK server adapter, passes user credentials for the access.redhat.com domain used in the Installer). This makes the CDK tooling ready for use in the IDE. After the installation is complete, run DevStudio directly from the Installer, open the Servers view and start the Container Development Environment server adapter. This will start CDK and create OpenShift Container Platform and Docker connections. Note that if you close the Installer window and then run DevStudio, your user credentials will not be passed automatically and you must enter your user credentials manually.

[[seperate_products]]
== Installing CDK and the IDE as Separate Products

You can download and install CDK and the IDE separately. This option requires some additional configuration steps before the two can be used together. 

[[prereq]]
=== Prerequisites

Ensure that the following are installed on your system:

* Ensure that hardware virtualization is enabled on your system
* Ensure that the following are installed on your system:
** Hypervisor such as VirtualBox, Linux KVM/libvirt, xhyve (macOS) or hyper-V (Windows) is installed and configured
** CDK 3.1
** DevStudio 11.0 
* Ensure that you have a Red Hat Developer account. For a new account, visit https://developers.redhat.com/. 


For details about installing these prerequisites, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_container_development_kit/3.0/html/installation_guide/[Red Hat Container Development Kit Installation Guide].

0pen the *OpenShift Explorer* view to see the IP address and the port of the OpenShift Container Platform that you have connected to: *developer _{connection_IP}_* (example, developer https://10.1.2.2:8443). Expand the connection to see the sample projects. You can also open the *Docker Explorer* view to view the Container Development Environment connection and expand the connection to see the Containers and Images. Choose to continue working with OpenShift Container Platform within DevStudio or view instructions for Container-based Development with DevStudio. 

[[docker_tool]]
== Using the Docker Tooling

After starting the CDK server in the IDE, you can follow one of two container development workflows:

. <<use_docker_tooling,Use Docker for Container-based Development>>
. <<build_image,Build Docker Image Using the Container Development Environment>>

[[use_docker_tooling]]
=== Use Docker for Container-based Development

Use Docker for Container-based Development as follows:

. Create a new project with your *Dockerfile*.
.. Click *File* > *New* > *Project*.
.. Type _java_ in the search bar and from the results, select *Java Project* and click *Next* to continue.
.. In the *Project name* field, type a name for the new project and click *Finish*. The *Project Explorer* view shows the project that you just created.
.. Click *File* > *New* > *File*.
.. In the *New File* window:
... In the *Enter or select the parent folder* field, click the project that you created.
... In the *File name* field, type _Dockerfile_ and click *Finish*. 
.. Edit the Dockerfile as desired and then save it. For example, copy and paste the following content in the dockerfile and then save the file: 
+

[[build_image]]
=== Build Docker Image Using the Container Development Environment

To do a Docker image build using the Container Development Environment:

. In the *Project Explorer* view, expand the project and right-click the Dockerfile and select *Run As* > *Docker Image Build*.
. In the *Docker Image Build Configuration* dialog box:
.. In the *Connection field, select your Container Development Environment server adapter.
.. In the *Image Name* field, enter the desired name for the docker image and click *OK*. After the build is done, a new image with the given name is listed in the *Docker Explorer* view under CDK Docker connection under images and in the *Docker Images* view. Also, the *Console* view shows *Successfully built _<Docker_image_ID>_* message. 
. Run a Docker image using the Container Development Environment:
.. Open the *Docker Explorer* view by typing Ctrl+3 in the quick access menu or using the *Window* > *Perspective* > *Open Perspective* > *Docker Tooling* menu option.
.. Navigate to the *Images* node under the Docker connection.
.. Right-click your image and click *Run*.
.. In the *Run a Docker Image* window, fill in the necessary details and click *Finish* to run your image. The *Console* view shows the progress of execution of the Docker image. Optionally, give the container a name. This name helps locate the specific container in a list of containers in the future.
.. In the *Docker Explorer* view, select the container that you named in the preceding step and expand its node and select the 8080 port and click *Show In* > *Web Browser* to access the application deployed in the Docker container. The application opens in the default web browser. 

=== Next Steps for the Docker Tooling

For further information about the basics of Docker Tooling, see link:docker_basics.html[Configure Docker Tooling (Basic)]

== Using OpenShift Container Platform Tooling

Use OpenShift Container Platform for Container-based Development as follows:

. Create a new OpenShift Container Platform project. These projects are like namespaces for OpenShift applications. They are different from how Eclipse projects relate to Eclipse applications. Additionally, Eclipse projects can be mapped to OpenShift applications.
.. In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, right-click the connection and click *New* > *Project* to create a new OpenShift Container Platform project. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The CDK server adapter creates the OpenShift Container Platform connection when you start the CDK server adapter in the preceding sections. 
====
+
.. Add the name and other relevant details for the new project and click *Finish*. 
. Create an application in your OpenShift Container Platform project using the templates:
.. Right-click your new project name and click *New* > *Application*.
.. In the *New OpenShift Application* window, search box, type the application type required. For example, for a *node.js* application, type _nodejs_ and from the displayed list, select the relevant nodejs template and click *Finish*.
.. Click *OK* to accept the results of the application creation process.
.. In the *Import OpenShift Application* window, select a *Git Clone Location* and click *Finish*. 

=== Next Steps for the OpenShift Tooling
