Mobile Hybrid Tools enables you to quickly create Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications using the `Hybrid Mobile Project` wizard. This wizard is a useful starting point for creating all new Cordova-based mobile applications in the IDE.

As illustrated in this article, from this foundation you can customize the application by adding a range of Cordova plug-ins for accessing device hardware with the `Cordova Plug-in Discovery` wizard. You can also test your Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications without leaving the IDE using CordovaSim, a mobile application simulator. The IDE also allows you to deploy your Hybrid Mobile project on the FeedHenry server.

The `Hybrid Mobile Project` wizard is also an ideal starting point for new users to Hybrid Mobile Tools and CordovaSim, guiding you through the necessary steps to set up the IDE and your system for developing Cordova applications before generating a basic Cordova project.

[NOTE]
====
Before attempting to install or create a hybrid mobile project with JBoss Tools, ensure that the Android SDK is installed and up to date. Creating or installing hybrid mobile projects without a working and updated installation of Android SDK can result in unexpected errors.

[[customize]]
== 2. Customize the Hybrid Mobile Project
Before building and running the Hybrid Mobile application, instructions are given here for customizing the project by adding the Cordova Device Motion plug-in and modifying the source code to make use of it. The plug-in gives access to the mobile device accelerometer and the code snippets added to this project check for data every one second and display the X, Y, Z acceleration values on the front page of the application. This plug-in is just one of a catalog of plug-ins available to add to your Hybrid Mobile project.

To customize the Hybrid Mobile project with the Cordova Device Motion plug-in, complete the following steps:

. In the `Project Explorer` view, right-click `_{project name}_` and click `Install Cordova Plug-in`.
. In the `Find` field, enter `motion`.
. From the filtered list of plug-ins, select `org.apache.cordova.device-motion` and click `Finish`.

+
[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="js/index.js"></script>
----
+
** Replace the code inside the `<body></body>` tags with the following lines
+
[source,html]
------------
<div class="app">
     <h1>My Cordova Accelerometer App</h1>
     <div id="accelerometer">Waiting for accelerometer...</div>
</div>
------------
+

. Double-click `index.js` to open it in the IDE JavaScript Editor.
. Replace the code in `index.js` with the following lines
+
[source, js]
----
// The watch id references the current `watchAcceleration`
    var watchID = null;

    // Wait for device API libraries to load
    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

    // device APIs are available
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log("deviceready");
        startWatch();
    }

    // Start watching the acceleration
    function startWatch() {

        // Update acceleration every 1 seconds
        var options = { frequency: 1000 };
        watchID = navigator.accelerometer.watchAcceleration(onSuccess, onError, options);
    }

    // Stop watching the acceleration
    function stopWatch() {
        if (watchID) {
            navigator.accelerometer.clearWatch(watchID);
            watchID = null;
        }
    }

    // onSuccess: Get a snapshot of the current acceleration
    function onSuccess(acceleration) {
        var element = document.getElementById('accelerometer');
        element.innerHTML = 'Acceleration X: ' + acceleration.x + '<br />' +
                            'Acceleration Y: ' + acceleration.y + '<br />' +
                            'Acceleration Z: ' + acceleration.z;
    }

    // onError: Failed to get the acceleration
    function onError() {
        alert('onError!');
    }
