= Importing Projects in the IDE Using Git Import
:page-layout: howto
:page-tab: docs

:experimental:
:imagesdir: ./images

The Git Import feature allows you to easily configure most of the settings required to make a project workable immediately after it is imported in the IDE.

The *Import* wizard assists you in importing projects into the IDE in one of the following ways:

. <<smart_import>>: Use this method if you are unaware of the type of the project that you are importing.
+
[NOTE]
====
We recommend using the Projects from Git (with smart import) option because it is the easiest and most efficient way to import projects into the IDE with minimal effort.
====
+
. <<from_git>>: Use this method when you are aware of the type of the project that you are importing.
.. <<existing_repo>>: Use this method if you have a cloned copy of the repository on your local system.
... <<existing_eclipse>>: Use to import Eclipse projects.
... <<new_project_wizard>>: Use to import a project that you want to begin working on from scratch.
... <<general_project>>: Use to import non-Eclipse projects.
.. <<clone_uri>>: Use this method if a cloned copy of the repository does not exist on your local system.

[NOTE]
====
The three options namely: importing existing eclipse projects, using the New Project wizard, and importing as a general project, are available under this method, too. 
====

[[smart_import]]
== Importing Projects from Git with Smart Import
Use the `Project from Git (with smart import)` option, if you are unaware of the type of the project that you want to import.

The `Import` wizard will automatically detect the type of project being imported and will configure the project so that you have to put in minimal effort to make the project workable.

The Git Import feature detects the various modules of a project that is a set of other individual projects. It detects markers such as `pom.xml`, `MANIFEST.MF`, etc. to determine the type of project that you are importing.

To import projects from Git with smart import:

. Click `File` > `Import`.
. In the `Import` window, click `Projects from Git (with smart import)` and click `Next`.
. In the `Select Repository Source` window, click `Existing local repository` or `Clone URI`.
. Step through the wizard and click `Finish` for the wizard to analyze the content of the project folder to find projects for import and import them in the IDE.
`Result:` The imported project is listed in the `Project Explorer` view.

[[from_git]]
== Importing Projects from Git
Use the `Projects from Git` option when you are aware of the type of project that you want to import into the IDE.

You can import projects in any one of the following ways:

. <<existing_repo>>
.. <<existing_eclipse>>
.. <<new_project_wizard>>
.. <<general_project>>
. <<clone_uri>>

[[existing_repo]]
=== Importing from the Existing local repositories
Use the `Existing local repository` option, if you have, at some point in time, cloned the remote Git repository and the repository is present on your local system.

[[existing_eclipse]]
==== Importing Existing Eclipse Projects
Use the `Existing local repositories` option to import Eclipse projects in the IDE. These projects essentially have a `.project` file. This `.project` file contains the project description and settings needed to configure and build project in Eclipse.

To import projects as existing Eclipse projects: 

. Click `File` > `Import`.
. In the `Import` wizard:
.. Expand `Git` and then click `Projects from Git`. Click `Next`.
.. Click `Existing local repository` and then click `Next`.
.. Click `Git` to choose one of the recently used repositories from the list or click `Add` to browse to any local repository. Click `Next`.
In the `Wizard for project import` section, click `Import existing Eclipse project`. Click `Next`. 
.. In the `Import Projects` window, select all the projects that you want to import.
.. Ensure that the `Select nested projects` check box is clicked to import the nested projects under the parent project that you are importing.
.. Click `Finish`.

`Result:` The imported project is listed in the `Project Explorer` view.

[[new_project_wizard]]
=== Importing Using the New Project Wizard
Use the `Import using the New Project wizard` option, if your repository is empty and you want to start developing a new project and then push the code to the remote repository. 

To import projects using the New Project wizard:

. Click `File` > `Import`.
. In the `Import` wizard:
.. Click `Git` > `Projects from Git`. Click `Next`.
.. Click `Existing local repository` and then click `Next`.
.. Click `Git` and then click `Next`.
.. In the `Wizard for project import` section, click `Import using the New Project wizard`. Click `Finish`.
.. In the `New Project` wizard, expand the category, and then click the project type that you want to create and import. Click `Next`.
+

+
.. In the `New _<type_of_project>_` window, fill in the information for the new project and click `Next` or `Finish` to create the new project.
`Result:` The imported project is listed in the `Project Explorer` view.

[[general_project]]
=== Importing as a General Project
Use the `Import as general project` option if the project being imported does not have a `.project` file, meaning it is not an Eclipse project. In this case Eclipse will create a clean `.project` file with default settings.

To import a project as a general project:

. Click `File` > `Import`.
. In the `Import` wizard:
.. Click `Git` > `Projects from Git`. Click `Next`.
.. Click `Existing local repository` and then click `Next`.
.. Click `Git` and then click `Next`.
.. In the `Wizard for project import` section, click `Import as general project`.
.. Select the project and click `Next`.
.. In the `Import Projects from Git` window, confirm or edit the default parameters and click `Finish`.

`Result:` The imported project is listed in the `Project Explorer` view.

[[clone_uri]]
== Importing Projects from the Remote Git Repository 
Use the `Clone URI` option to clone the repository on your system if you have never cloned the Git repository; meaning, the repository does not exist on your local system.

[NOTE]
====
The three options, importing existing eclipse projects, importing using the New Project wizard, and importing as a general project, are available under the Clone URI method, too. For detailed steps, see the preceding sections: <<existing_eclipse>>, <<new_project_wizard>>, and <<general_project>>.
====

To import projects in the Cloned URI:

. Click `File` > `Import`.
. In the `Import` wizard:
.. Click `Git` > `Projects from Git` and then click `Next`.
.. Click `Clone URI` and click `Next`.
.. In the `Source Git Repository` window, in the `URI` field, enter an existing Git repository URL, either local or remote and click `Next`.
+

+
.. In the `Branch Selection` window, click all the branches that you want to clone from the remote repository and click `Next`.
+
image::git_import_branch_selection.png[Select Branch]
+
.. In the `Local Destination` window, ensure that the directory that you want to set as the local storage location for the repository is selected in the `Directory` field. Or, click `Browse` to select the location.
+
The `Cloning from _<GitHub_repository>_` window shows the progress of the cloning process.
+
.. In the `Select a wizard to use for importing projects` window, `Import as general project` is selected by default. Click `Next`.
.. In the `Import Projects` window, ensure that the `Directory` field shows the path to the directory where you want to import the projects and click `Finish`.
`Result:` The imported project is listed in the `Project Explorer` view. The cloned repository of the remote Git repository is now located in the local file system.
