The fastest way to evaluate using Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 9 with OpenShift 3 is to create a connection in JBoss Developer Studio to an existing OpenShift 3 instance. **OpenShift 3 tooling is not installed by default in JBoss Developer Studio but is instead available as a Technology Preview feature.**

== Add the OpenShift 3 Tooling to the IDE
The IDE does not include OpenShift 3 by default. OpenShift 2 is available and supported, but OpenShift 3 is a Technology Preview and must be installed as follows:

1. Navigate to the `JBoss Central` view and click the **Software/Update** tab.
2. In the `Find` field, type *OpenShift*.
3. Click the checkbox next to `JBoss OpenShift 3 Tools` and click **Install/Update (1)**.
4. In the `Install` dialog box, ensure that the checkboxes for **JBoss OpenShift 3 Tools** and **JBoss Tools EGit Integration** are selected and click **Next** and then **Next** again to confirm.
5. Read the license text and select the relevant radio button to indicate agreement and click **Finish**.
6. Read the security warning and click **OK** to proceed.
7. Click **Yes** when prompted to restart the IDE for the changes to take effect.

**Result:** OpenShift 3 Tooling is now installed in the IDE.
