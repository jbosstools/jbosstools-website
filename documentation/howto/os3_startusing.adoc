The OpenShift 3 Tooling allows users to create, import, and modify OpenShift 3 applications as follows:

. <<connection, Create a New OpenShift 3 Connection>>
. <<project, Create a New OpenShift 3 Project>>
. <<application, Create a New OpenShift 3 Application>>
. <<import_app, Import an Existing OpenShift 3 Application into the IDE>>
. <<deploy_app, Deploy an Application Using the Server Adapter>>
. <<view_app,View an Existing Application in a Web Browser>>
. <<delete_app, Delete an OpenShift Project>>

[[connection]]
== Create a New OpenShift 3 Connection
To be able to use the OpenShift 3 tooling in the IDE, you must first create an OpenShift 3 connection.
To create a new OpenShift 3 connection:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, click `New Connection Wizard`. In case the `OpenShift Explorer` view is not available, click `Window` > `Show View` > `Other` and then in the `Show View` window search for `OpenShift Explorer` and click `OK` after you find it.

. In the `New OpenShift Connection` wizard:
+
	a. In the `Connection` list, click `<New Connection>`.

	b. In the `Server type` list, click `OpenShift 3`.

   	c. In the `Server` field, type the URL for an OpenShift 3 server.

   	d. In the `Authentication` section, in the `Protocol` list, click `OAuth` to authenticate using the token or click `Basic` to authenticate using login credentials.
+
. Click `Finish`.

`Result:` The connection is listed in the `OpenShift Explorer` view.

[[project]]
== Create a New OpenShift 3 Project
To create a new OpenShift 3 project:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, right-click the connection and click `New` > `Project`.

. In the `Create OpenShift Project` window:
+
	a. In the `Project Name` field, type a name for the project. Project names must be alphanumeric and can contain the character “-” but must not begin or end with this character.

	b. In the `Display Name` field, type a display name for the project. This name is used as the display name for your project in the `OpenShift Explorer` view and on the OpenShift web console after the project is created.

	c. In the `Description` field, type a description of the project.
+
. Click `Finish`.

`Result:` The project is listed in the `OpenShift Explorer` view, under the relevant connection.

[[application]]
== Create a New OpenShift 3 Application
Use the `New OpenShift Application` wizard to create OpenShift applications from default or custom templates. Using a template to create an application is useful because the same template can be used to create multiple similar applications with different or identical configurations for each of them.

[NOTE]
====
To learn more about using and creating templates with OpenShift 3, see https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html[Using Templates with OpenShift 3].
====

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, right-click the connection and click `New` > `Application`.

. If required, in the `New OpenShift Application` wizard, sign into your OpenShift server using the `Basic` protocol (username and password) or the `OAuth` protocol (token) and click `Next`.

. In the `Select Template` window, click the `Server application source` tab.
+
[NOTE]
====
To create an application from the a local template, click the `Local template` tab and then click `Browse File System` or `Browse Workspace` to locate the template that you want to base the project on.
====
+
. From the list, click the template that you want to base your project on. You can also use the `type filter text` field to search for specific templates.

. Click `Next`.
+
.Select a Template for Project Creation

+
. In the `Template Parameters` window, confirm the parameter values and click `Next`.

. In the `Resource Labels` window, confirm the labels that you want to add to each resource. You can also click `Add` or `Edit` to add labels or edit the existing ones.

. Click `Finish`.

. In the `Results of creating the resources from the _[template_name]_` window, review the details and click `OK`.

. In the `Import Application` window, click `Use default clone destination` to clone the application at the default location or in the `Git Clone Location` field, type or browse for the location where you want to clone the application and click `Finish`.
+
.Select a Git Clone Location
image::os3_createapp_clonelocation.png[Select a Git Clone Location]
+
[NOTE]
====
If the Git location chosen to clone the application already contains a folder with the application name that you are trying to import, you must select a new location for the Git clone. In case you do not select a new location, the existing repository will be reused with the changes you made being retained but not reflected on the OpenShift console.

`Result:` The application appears in the `Project Explorer` view.

[[import_app]]
== Import an Existing OpenShift 3 Application into the IDE

[NOTE]
====
Only an application that has its source specified in the `build config` file can be imported in the workspace.
====

Applications associated with your OpenShift account(s) are listed in the `OpenShift Explorer` view. The source code for these applications can be individually imported into the IDE using the OpenShift tools `Import OpenShift Application` wizard. Once imported, the user can easily modify the application source code, as required, build the application and view it in a web browser.

To import an existing OpenShift 3 application as a new project in the existing IDE workspace:

. If required, sign into your OpenShift server using the `Basic` protocol or the `OAuth` protocol.

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection to locate the application to import.

. Right-click _{project name}_ and click `Import Application`.
+
[NOTE]
====
To import a particular application from a service, right-click the service and then click `Import Application`. If you right-click a project and click `Import Application`, and if there are more than one build configs with source code under a project, you will be prompted to select the desired application for import because of existence of several applications under one project.
====
+
. In the `Import OpenShift Application` wizard, `Existing Build Configs` list, click the application that you want to import and click `Next`.

. Ensure the location in the `Git Clone Destination` field corresponds to where you want to make a local copy of the OpenShift application Git repository and click `Finish`.

`Result:` The application is listed in the `Project Explorer` view.

[[deploy_app]]
== Deploy an Application Using the Server Adapte

The server adapter allows incremental deployment of applications directly into the deployed pods on OpenShift.

To deploy an application:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection, the project, and then the application.

. Right-click the _{application_name}_ and click `Server Adapter`.
In the `Server Settings` window, `Services` section, select the service.
+
[NOTE]
====
A workspace project will be selected automatically, if the OpenShift service has a Build Config with a git URL matching the git remote URL of one of the workspace projects.
====
+
. Click `Finish`.

`Result:` The `Servers` view is the view in focus with the server showing `[Started, Publishing…]` followed by the `Console` view showing the progress of application publishing.

[[view_app]]
== View an Existing Application in a Web Browser

To view an application in the internal web browser, after it has been successfully deployed, in the `OpenShift Explorer` view, right-click the application, and click `Show In` > `Web browser`.

`Result:` The application displays in the built-in web browser.

[[delete_app]]
== Delete an OpenShift Project

You may choose to delete a project from the workspace to make a fresh start in project development or after you have concluded development in a project. All resources associated with a project get deleted when the project is deleted.

To delete an OpenShift 3 project:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection and then the project to locate the application you want to delete.

. Right-click _{project name}_ and click `Delete Project`.

. In the `OpenShift resource deletion` window, click `OK`.

[NOTE]
====
To delete more than one project (and the containing applications), in the `OpenShift Explorer` view, click the project to select it and while holding the Control key select another project that you want to delete and then press Delete.
====

== Did You Know

* Scale the project deployment, using the context menu for the service (the first node below the project). You can also scale the deployment from the `Properties` tab of a deployment (replication controller) and deploymentconfig.

* View the rsync output in the `Console` view. You can also see the progress of the file transfer after you publish local changes to OpenShift.
