JBoss Tools' OpenShift 3 Tooling allows users to create, import, and modify OpenShift 3 applications and then set up manual or automatic builds for changes to the new applications as follows:

. <<add_osv3,Add the OpenShift 3 Tooling to the IDE>>
. <<create_app_template,Create a new OpenShift 3 Application Using a Template>>
. <<import_app,Import an Existing OpenShift 3 Application>>
. <<build_app_manually,Build an Application Manually>>
. <<set_up_githooks,Build an Application Automatically>>
. <<view_app,View an Existing Application in a Web Browser>>
. <<delete_project,Delete an OpenShift Project>>

[add_osv3]
== Add the OpenShift 3 Tooling to the IDE
The IDE does not include OpenShift 3 as a default. OpenShift 2 is available and supported, but OpenShift 3 is a Technology Preview and must be installed as follows:

1. Navigate to the `JBoss Central` view and click the **Software/Update** tab.
2. In the `Find` field, type *OpenShift*.
3. Click the checkbox next to `JBoss OpenShift 3 Tools` and click **Install/Update (1)**.
4. In the `Install` dialog box, ensure that the checkboxes for **JBoss OpenShift 3 Tools** and **JBoss Tools EGit Integration** are selected and click **Next** and then **Next** again to confirm.
5. Read the license text and select the relevant radio button to indicate agreement and click **Finish**.
6. Read the security warning and click **OK** to proceed.
7. Click **Yes** when prompted to restart the IDE for the changes to take effect.

**Result:** OpenShift 3 Tooling is now installed in the IDE.

[create_app_template]
== Create a new OpenShift 3 Application Using a Template

Use the new `OpenShift Application` wizard to create OpenShift applications from default or custom templates. Using a template to create an application is useful because the same template can be used to create multiple similar applications with different or identical configurations for each of them.

**Note:** To learn more about using and creating templates with OpenShift 3, see https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html[Using Templates with OpenShift 3]

. In `JBoss Central`, click **OpenShift Application**.
. If required, in the `New OpenShift Application` wizard, sign into your OpenShift server and click **Next**.
. Click the **Manage Project** link. If there are no previously created projects on the server, the `Create OpenShift Project` wizard displays the fields to create a new project.
. In the `OpenShift Projects` window, click **New** and enter the following project details:
.. In the `Project Name` field, type a name for the project. Project names must be alphanumeric and can contain the character “-” but must not begin or end with this character.
.. In the `Display Name` field, type a display name for the project. This name is used as the display name for your project in the `OpenShift Explorer` view and on the OpenShift website after the project is created.
.. In the `Description` field, type a description of the project.
.. Click **Finish**.
. In the `OpenShift Projects` window, click **OK**.
. In the `New OpenShift Application` window:
.. Ensure that the `Project` field displays the name of the relevant project.
.. To use a template from the server, click **Use a template from the server** and select the relevant template. You can also use the `type filter` text field to search for specific templates.
.. To use a custom template from your local machine:
... Click `Use a template from my local file system` and click **Browse**.
... Select the template and click **OK** to continue.
. Click **Next**.

+
**Important:** Ensure that you have push access to the repository mentioned in the GIT_URI parameter field so that you can push the local changes to the OpenShift server. It is recommended that you fork the original Git repository and replace the default GIT_URI value with the URL of your forked repository.
. In the `Resource Labels` window, confirm the labels that you want to add to each resource. You can also click **Add** or **Edit** to add labels or edit the existing ones.
. Click **Finish**.
+
.Create Resource Labels
image::os3_art1_create_resourcelabels.png[Create Resource Labels]
+
. Review the details and click **OK** on the `Create Application Summary` window.

In the `Create Application Summary` window, click the link to obtain the GitHub webhook and use it to automate the build process. In the Create Application Summary window, click the link to obtain the build trigger webhook and use it to automate the build process. A GitHub specific webhook is available for project sources hosted on GitHub. A generic Git webhook is available for other Git repositories. For detailed steps to set up GitHub webhooks, see <<set_up_githooks,Build an Application Automatically>>.

**Note:** The link to obtain the webhook is available only for projects created from templates that have GitHub repositories.

.Create Webhook Triggers

**Result:** The application appears in the `Project Explorer` view. To view the application in a web browser, in the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection and then expand `Routes`, right-click the specific resource and then click **Show In > Web Browser**.

[import_app]
== Import an Existing OpenShift 3 Application into the IDE

**Note:** Only an application that has its source specified in the build config file can be imported into the workspace.

Applications associated with your OpenShift account(s) are listed in the `OpenShift Explorer` view. The source code for these applications can be individually imported into the IDE using the OpenShift Tools Import OpenShift Application wizard. Once imported, the user can easily modify the application source code, as required, build the application and view it in a web browser.

To import an existing OpenShift 3 application as a new project in the existing IDE workspace:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, ensure your OpenShift connection is listed or click the connection icon image:os3_art1_import_connectionicon.png[] and enter your OpenShift account details to create a new connection.
. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection to locate the application to import.
. Right-click `{project name}` and click **Import Application**.
. In the `Import OpenShift Application` wizard's `Existing Build Configs`  list, click the application that you want to import and click **Next**.
. Ensure the location in the `Git Clone Destination` field corresponds to where you want to make a local copy of the OpenShift application Git repository and click **Finish**.

**Result:** Once imported, the application is listed in the `Project Explorer` view.

== Build an Application

The user can either build the application manually or use the GitHub webhooks to build it automatically. Building applications automatically makes the build process quicker. Also, if set to build automatically, the application build process is triggered every time a change is made to the application source code without you having to remember to build it manually.

[build_app_manually]
=== Build an Application Manually

To build an application manually:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection, then expand the `{project_name}`, and then expand `Build Configs`.
. Right-click the application name and click **Start Build**.

**Result:** The `Builds` folder in the `OpenShift Explorer` view shows the status of the build.

[set_up_githooks]
=== Build an Application Automatically Using Git Webhooks

The IDE allows you to either build OpenShift 3 applications manually (<<build_app_manually,Build an Application Manually>>) or build them automatically by setting up GitHub webhooks. Since OpenShift 3 does not provide a Git repository that can directly push the changes to the OpenShift server, set up webhooks to push any changes made to a project file and to build an application automatically. By setting up webhooks, you can configure your GitHub repository to make a webhook call whenever you want to push the changes made to a project file.

To add a webhook to your GitHub repository:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection and then expand **Build Configs**.
. Right-click the `Build Configs` resource and then click **Show Webhooks**.
. Copy the webhook in the `GitHub webhook` field.
+
.Create a Git Webhook
image::os3_art1_webhook.png[Create a Git Webhook]
+
. In the Webhooks triggers window, click the GitHub link to navigate to the GitHub repository.
. Click Settings.
. In the Options section, click `Webhooks & services` and then click **Add webhook**.
. In the `Payload URL` field, paste the copied webhook and then click **Add webhook**.

**Result:** A Git webhook is now set up to trigger automatic builds for your OpenShift 3 application.

[view_app]
== View an Existing Application in a Web Browser

To view an application in the internal web browser after it has been successfully deployed, in the `OpenShift Explorer` view, right-click the application, and click **Show In > Web browser**.

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, right-click the application, and click **Show In > Web browser**.

**Result:** The application displays in the built-in web browser.

[delete_project]
== Delete an OpenShift Project

You may choose to delete a project from the workspace to make a fresh start in project development or after you have concluded development in a project. All resources associated with a project get deleted when the project is deleted.

To delete an OpenShift 3 project:

. In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, expand the connection to locate the application you want to delete.
. Right-click `{project name}` and click **Delete Project**.
. In the OpenShift project deletion window, click **OK**.

**Result:** The selected project is now removed.
