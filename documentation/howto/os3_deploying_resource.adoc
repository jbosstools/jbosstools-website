In this article, you use the *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs* template in OpenShift Container Platform as an example to define resources for your OpenShift Container Platform application. Use similar steps to define resources for any other OpenShift Container Platform application.

*Prerequisite*

* Install Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) 3. For detailed instructions to install CDK 3, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_container_development_kit/3.0/html/installation_guide/.

== Deploying the s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs Template

Set up the IDE to work with CDK 3 as described in http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/howto/cdk_howto.html[Using the IDEâ€™s Container Development Kit Tooling]. The new connection for OpenShift Container Platform is listed in the *OpenShift Explorer* view, making the *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs* template available for use.

To deploy the template:

. In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, expand the connection and right-click the _{project name}_ and click *New* > *Application*.
. In the *New OpenShift Application* window:
.. In the *OpenShift project* field, click the project that you want to create the new application in.
.. In the *Server application source* tab, scroll through the list and locate and click *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs (quickstart, java, springboot, fis) - openshift*.
. Click *Finish*.
. In the *Create Application Summary* window, click *OK*.
. In the *Import OpenShift Application* window in the *Git Clone Location* field, enter the location where you want to clone the template and click *Finish*.

+
. In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, expand the project, expand the *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs* application and then right-click the *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs-1* build and click *Build Log*. The *Console* view shows the progress of the build.

*Result:* The *Console* view shows the *latest: digest: sha256:{checksum} size: 9033
Push successful* message.

== Viewing the Application in the Web Console

[NOTE]
====
This section is required optionally if you want to see the application running on the terminal.
====

In the absence of a service or route, you can view the application through the *Pod* tab in the web console.

To view the application in the Pod: 

. In the web console, click *Applications* > *Pod* and then click the *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs-1* pod.
. Click the *Logs* tab.
. In the logs, locate *Jolokia: Agent started with URL https://172.17.0.6:8778/jolokia/* and copy the IP address (*172.17.0.6*, in this example).
. Click the *Terminal* tab.
. In the terminal, type the following command: `curl http://_{IP_address}_:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello`. 
+
Example: `curl http://172.17.0.6:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello` 
+
. Press Enter. 
. Append the next line with: `curl http://172.17.0.6:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/_{your_name}_` and press Enter. 
+
Example: `curl http://172.17.0.6:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/John`
+
*Result:* The *Hello John, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!* message appears, showing that application is up and running.

== Defining Services and Routes Using a JSON File

Use the `services-route.json` file to create the service for the *s2i-spring-boot-cfx-jaxrs* application and then create a route for the service. In this case the target port is 8080 where the route sends the request to the application.

To define the resources:

. Copy the following content and paste it in a file, name the file `services-routes.json`, and save it.

. The *Create Resource Summary* window shows the details of the created service and route. Click *OK*.
. In the *OpenShift Explorer* view, right-click the project and click *Show in* > *Web browser*. The *Whitelabel Error Page* shows that the application has no explicit mapping.
. In the address bar, append the URL with `services/helloservice/sayHello/`. The URL should now look like: *http://s2i-spring-boot-cxf-jaxrs-_{project_name}_._{IP_address}_.nip.io/services/helloservice/sayHello/.*
. Press Enter. The web browser shows the *Welcome to the CXF RS Spring Boot application, append /{name} to call the hello service* message.
. At the end of the URL, append a name, for example: *http://s2i-spring-boot-cxf-jaxrs-{project_name}.{IP_address}.nip.io/services/helloservice/sayHello/John*.

*Result:* The page displays the message: *Hello John, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!*
