= Create and Deploy your First OpenShift Online Application with OpenShift Tools

OpenShift Tools provides an all-in-one `New OpenShift Application` wizard for creating new OpenShift applications from templates and existing projects. This wizard is the starting point for creating all new OpenShift Online applications from the IDE and also for importing OpenShift Online applications to your workspace.

The `New OpenShift Application` wizard is an ideal starting point for new users to OpenShift and OpenShift Tools as it guides you through all the steps necessary to set up the IDE to use your OpenShift Online account and configure your account ready for applications.

The instructions here demonstrate how to use this wizard and a default OpenShift application template to create a basic OpenShift Online application. This includes one-time steps (marked with N), such as signing up for an OpenShift Online account, creating an OpenShift Online domain and uploading SSH keys. If you have previously used OpenShift Online and OpenShift Tools, you can omit these one-time steps as appropriate.     

== Start the New OpenShift Application Wizard
. In `JBoss Central`, under `Start from scratch`, click `OpenShift Application`.

== (N) Sign up for an OpenShift Online Account
[start=2]
. If you do not have an OpenShift Online account, click the link provided to sign up for an OpenShift account and follow the instructions on the OpenShift website.

. If you are prompted that the authenticity of the host cannot be established and asked whether you want to continue connecting, ensure that the host name matches that of your application and domain and click `Yes`.

== Some OpenShift Terminology
* Gear: A server container with a set of resources that allow you to run your application
* Cartridge: Plug-ins that house the framework or components that can be used to create and run your application
** Standalone cartridge: Languages and application servers that serve your application
** Embedded cartridge: Functionality to enhance your application
* Scaling: Enables your application to react to changes in traffic and automatically allocate the necessary resources to handle the current demand

== Did You Know
* You can also start the `New OpenShift Application` wizard from the `OpenShift Explorer` view by right-clicking a connection, domain or existing application and clicking `New` &rarr; `Application`.
* To save time when logging in to OpenShift Online in future, you can click the `Save Password` check box in the `Sign in to OpenShift` window. The password is retained in secure storage provided by the IDE and automatically populates the `Password` field for the associated connection.
* Using the `New OpenShift Application` wizard, you can also create a new OpenShift application from an existing workspace project or a Git source.
