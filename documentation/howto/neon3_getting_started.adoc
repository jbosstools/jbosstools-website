= Getting Started with JavaScript Development for Neon 3
:page-layout: howto
:page-tab: docs
:page-status: green
:experimental:
:imagesdir: ./images

Use Neon 3 features in the IDE to complete the following tasks:

. <<package_manager>> 
.. <<create_new_project>>
.. <<enable_bower>>
.. <<enable_npm>>
.. <<new_index_file>>
.. <<use_bower>>
. <<build_system>>  
.. <<add_dependencies>>
.. <<enable_gulp>>
.. <<create_gulpfile.js>>
.. <<use_gulp>>
. <<nodejs_app>>
.. <<import_jsdt_node_test_project>>
.. <<run_indexjs>>
.. <<debug_nodejs>>

Neon 3 now also uses the new Esprima parser that supports ECMAScript 2015 (JavaScript 6). 
This parser is intuitive and assists in the following tasks:

* Syntax coloration
* Validation
* Content assist
* Templates for keywords
* Class definition
* Template literals
* Integration with Outline View

[[package_manager]]
== Using the Package Managers
Bower and npm are Package Managers that allow you to install, in a single click, all the dependencies required for the plugins to work. 

In this section, we list steps for enabling Bower Init and npm Init. You may choose to work with any one of these Package Managers and follow the respective procedure:

* <<enable_bower>>
* <<enable_npm>>

If you are using npm you must use the file `package.json` and if using Bower, use the file `bower.json`.

=== Prerequisites
Ensure that npm and bower are installed on your system by running the `npm -v` and `bower -v` commands on the command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If installing both npm and bower, ensure that you install npm before you install Bower.

* For detailed instructions to install npm, see <<install_npm>> in the Appendix.
* To install Bower, run the command `npm install -g bower` as the root user.
====

[[create_new_project]]
=== Creating a New Project
In this section, you create a new project so that you can later enable the dependencies and see how the Neon 3 features work.

To create a project:

. Click *File* > *Project*.
. In the *New Project* wizard, click *General* > *Project*. Click *Next*.
. In the *Project name* field, type the name of the project (*Neon3_features*, in this example).
. Edit the other fields if required and then click *Finish*.

*Result:* The new project is listed in the *Project Explorer* view.

[[enable_bower]]
=== Enabling Bower Init
After you have enabled Bower Init the result will be a `bower.json` file listed under the project in the *Project Explorer* view.

To enable Bower Init:

. In the *Project Explorer* view, right-click *Neon3_features* and then click *New* > *Other*.
. In the *New* wizard, *type filter text* field, type _bower_. After *Bower Init* is selected, click *Next*.

To be able to view the themes and styles applied to the page, you must edit the `bower.json` file that contains the dependencies.
+
To edit the `bower.json` file:

. In the *Project Explorer* view, double-click *bower.json* to open it in the default text editor. 
The json editor Outline support:

* Allows you to navigate through the json file
* Allows you to validate syntax errors

. To define the jquery and bootstrap dependencies:

.. After the closing square bracket *]*, add a comma (*,*).
.. On the next line type:
+
[source, java]
----
       "dependencies" : {
          "jquery" : "*",
          "bootstrap" : "~3.3.6"
          }
----

[[build_system]]
== Using the Build Systems
In this section, you will use the npm Package Manager and hence the `package.json` file.

You can either use the Grunt or the Gulp build systems to run your tasks directly from the IDE instead of switching to the CLI every time you want to run a task. 

=== Prerequisites
* Ensure that Gulp or Grunt plugins are installed on your system by running the following command:

** For Gulp plugin, run the command: `gulp -v`
** For the Grunt plugin, run the command:  `grunt -v`

If not installed, use the following commands to install them:

* To install the Gulp plugin, run the command `npm install --global gulp-cli` as the root user.
* To install the Grunt plugin, run the command `npm install --global grunt-cli` as the root user. 

[NOTE]
====
This section describes the workflow for Gulp. However, Grunt and Gulp are both supported and they both have similar workflows.
====

[[add_dependencies]]
=== Adding Dependencies to the package.json File
[NOTE]
====
This section is applicable only if you are using the `package.json` file. Skip this section if you are using the `bower.json` file.
====

You must add the dependencies to the `package.json` file to be able to use it in <<enable_gulp>>.

To add the dependencies:

. In the *Project Explorer* view, expand *neon3_features* and double-click *package.json* to open the file in the default editor.
. After *"license": "ISC"*, add a comma (*,*).
. On the next line add the following code snippet:
+
[source, java]
----
    "devDependencies" : {
    "jquery" : "*",
     "angular" : "*",
    "bootstrap" : "~3.3.6"
----    
+
. Save the file. The contents of the `package.json` file are as displayed in the following image.

.package.json File as Edited
image::neon3_package_json_edited.png[package.json File as Edited]

[[enable_gulp]]
=== Enabling the Gulp Plugin
To be able to use the task runners Grunt or Gulp, you must first define the following dependencies required for these plugins:

* In the `bower.json` file, under dependencies you must have *_“gulp”:”*”_ or _“grunt”:”*”_.
* In the `package.json` file, under dependencies you must have _“gulp”:”*”_ or _“grunt”:”*”_.

[NOTE]
====
In this section, we elaborate steps to enable the Gulp plugin. Use the same steps to enable the Grunt plugin. 
====

To enable the Gulp plugin:

. In the *Project Explorer* view, expand *neon3_features* and double-click *package.json* to open it in the default editor.
. In the `package.json` file, under *devDependencies*,  after the last dependency defined in the file, type a comma (*,*).
. On the next line, type _"gulp": "*"_. 
. On the next line type _"gulp-rename": "*"_ and save the file. The contents of the `package.json` file are as displayed in the following image.
+
.package.json File with Gulp Enabled
image::neon3_package_json_gulp_enabled.png[package.json File with Gulp Enabled]
+
. In the `package.json` file, click *Run As* > *npm Install*. The *Console* view shows the progress of the task. Overlook any warnings at this point of time.

*Result:* The *node_modules* folder displays under the project in the *Project Explorer* view.

[[create_gulpfile.js]]
=== Creating the gulpfile.js File
In this section, you create the `gulpfile.js` file to be used in <<use_gulp>>.

To create the `gulpfile.js`:

. Right-click *neon3_features* and then click *New* > *Other*.
. In the *New* wizard, search field, type _JavaScript_.
. Click *JavaScript Source File* and then click *Next*.
In the *New JavaScript file* window:
.. Cick *neon3_features*.
.. In the *File name* field, type _gulpfile.js_.
. Click *Finish*. The empty file opens in the default editor.
. Copy the following content and paste it in the `gulpfile.js` file:
+
[source,java]
----
    var gulp = require('gulp')
, rename = require('gulp-rename');

// task
gulp.task('default', function () {
        gulp.src('./index.html') //path to file to be renamed
        .pipe(rename('renamed.html')) // rename index.html to renamed.html
        .pipe(gulp.dest('renamed-html')); // destination folder
});
----
+
. Save the file. The contents of the `gulpfile.js` file are as displayed in the following image. 

.gulpfile.js File
