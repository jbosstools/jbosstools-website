To install the Integration Stack tools with JBDS, first install JBoss Developer Studio from the link:https://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio.html[all-in-one installer], bundled and configured out of the box with everything you need to get started. Alternatively, if you already have eclipse-jee-luna installed, you can install link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-luna[JBoss Developer Studio] or link:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-tools-luna[JBoss Tools] from the Eclipse Marketplace via *Help > Eclipse Marketplace...*

Once Developer Studio is installed, restart Eclipse and select the Software/Update tab in the JBoss Central view.  The current 8.0.2.GA integration stack is available automatically with the released *JBoss Data Virtualization Development* tooling.  The remainder of the integration tooling is available as *Early Access* so you must check the *Enable Early Access* checkbox in the installer window in order to install.
