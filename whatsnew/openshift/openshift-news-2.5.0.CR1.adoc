== What's New in 2.5.0.CR1
=== Application Wizard

Creation log for all applications 	When creating applications you want to know about the credentials that OpenShift initially set for you. This is especially helpful and required when you create a jenkins where you get it's url and username/password presented.
With CR1 we now present you what OpenShift did for you if there's anything to be noticed for any type of application and/or cartridge.
