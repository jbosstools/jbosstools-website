          The user forums should be your first port of call for any user-related issues with JBoss Tools.  Be it a question, wanting to report a bug, looking for advice, or simply sharing some cool stories you may have. 
          %br
          We have two forums, one for JBoss Tools and one for JBoss Developer Studio.

      %h3 Developers Mailing List
    .item
      %p
        This is a mailing list geared towards developing JBoss Tools itself.  It often contains deep, technical discussions on how JBoss Tools works internally, how new features could be implemented, and is definitely not the place for end user questions such as how to configure, use or even troubleshoot JBoss Tools.  Please use the User Forums for such questions.
      %p
        If, however, you are helping contribute to JBoss Tools, we welcome your thoughts, ideas and overall participation on the developers' mailing list.
