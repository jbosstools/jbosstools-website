      ##### JBoss Developer Studio
      **JBoss Developer Studio** is the product that bundles all the Eclipse Plugins that you can find in the **JBoss Tools Project** here
       (see the [features](../features) page for more information about the plugins).
      
      The easiest way to getting started with the Eclipse Plugins for JBoss Technology is by downloading and installing 
      the free [JBoss Developer Studio](http://devstudio.jboss.com/download/). It is a bundled version of Eclipse IDE along with all the JBoss Tools Plugins and 
      an universal installer that works on Windows, MacOSX and Linux, both in 32bits and 64bits. 
      [Give it a try](http://devstudio.jboss.com/download/) ! (a Red Hat Portal account is required, but don't worry, it is free). 
    
      You can also select the subscription-based [JBoss Developer Studio Portfolio Edition](http://devstudio.jboss.com/download/) 
      which comes bundled with [JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)](http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/application/)
      if you plan to develop on this platform and you need support for it.
      
      ##### JBoss Tools
      We understand that you may however prefer installing the plugins on your existing Eclipse runtime, 
      and we provide you with the following installation mode:
      
      -  the workbench built-in access to the **Eclipse Marketplace** (only the latest stable version of JBoss Tools is available there, though), 
      -  the **Update Site** (go to "Help>Install New Software...", click on "Add..." and input the Update Site URL into the "location" field)
      -  the **Downloaded zip file** (then go to "Help>Install New Software...", click on "Add..." and use "Local..." or "Archive..." to select the downloaded bundle).
  
      JBoss Tools is now splitted into two separate packages:
      
      - the **Core** version, which contains plugins for CDI, Hibernate, Web Services, OpenShift, AS, Central, etc.
      - the **SOA** version, which provides more specific plugins for BRMS (JBPM, Drools, etc.)
     
      The table below provides you with the links to the version of JBoss Tools you want to install:
