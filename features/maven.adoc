The Maven integration builds on top of Eclipse http://www.eclipse.org/m2e[m2e] and http://www.eclipse.org/m2e-wtp[m2e-wtp] to further closing the gap between the maven world and the Eclipse/WebTools world.

=== Easy switching

If your project heavily use maven profiles you can now smoothly toggle the various profiles on and off for 
individual as well as multiple projects.   

== Maven Configurators
=== No need for manual setup

With configurators for CDI, Hibernate, Seam and others you only have to have these configured 
in your pom.xml and Maven integration will enable the Eclipse tooling for these. Allows
easier and more consisten eclipse project setup between developers.
