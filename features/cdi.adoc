CDI Tools validation covers most of the problems defined in the CDI specification. There are more than a hundred validation rules including definition errors and deployment problems. Some of the problems can be fixed via Quick Fixes menu (Ctrl+1).

=== Quick access to source

Hyperlinks help you to navigate between source files. For example Ctrl+Click or F3 on any injection point will navigate you to the corresponding bean definition. If the injection point has multiple eligible beans, you can see a full list of these beans. Navigation also works in beans.xml. Observers, Events, Producer and Disposer methods can be navigated via hyperlinks too.

== EL support 
=== The power of CDI + JSF
