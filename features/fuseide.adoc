== Fuse Tooling
=== Fuse Tooling Applications

JBoss Fuse Tooling provides a set of developer tools that enable you to work with Fuse and Apache versions of 
ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, Karaf, and ServiceMix. You can connect and configure Enterprise Integration Patterns to 
build routes, browse endpoints and routes, drag and drop messages onto and from running routes, trace message 
flows, edit running routes, browse and visualize runtime processes via JMX and deploy your project's code to 
Red Hat JBoss Fuse, Fabric8, Apache ServiceMix and Apache Karaf containers.


== Fuse Camel Editor
=== Editing of Camel routes

Fuse Camel Editor provides the tools for creating a Fuse project, including the route editor, 
with its palette of supported Enterprise Integration Patterns, and the logic for running camel contexts inside 
the editor. If you only want to create, test and visualize routes, but not to debug them, you only need to install 
the JBoss Fuse Camel Editor feature.


== Fuse Runtimes 
=== Monitor and Debug Camel Routes

image::images/features-fuse-tracing.png[Debug Routes]

Allows you to debug and monitor camel routes running in JMX connected containers and to deploy camel routes to 
JMX connected containers. You are enabled to trace messages of running Camel routes and to start / stop Camel
contexts. With the Fabric8 perspective you are also able to manage a fabric and to deploy to a specific profile
of that fabric.


== Fuse Server Extensions 
=== Manage Servers

image::images/features-fuse-servers.png[Fuse Server Adapters]

Extends the functionality of the JBoss Fuse Tooling to allow you to configure, run, and interact with any 
of the supported servers via a Karaf command shell inside Fuse Tooling. For example, with Fuse installed on 
your machine, you can start it up and then create a fabric in which to deploy the camel routes you created 
with the Fuse Camel Editor. Use the shipped server adapters for Apache Karaf, Apache ServiceMix and 
JBoss Fuse to download and install a server on your local machine.


== Feature galore
=== More is more

Fuse Tooling streamlines the process at all stages of application development:

* Creating a Maven project for your application.
The tooling loads all of the relevant Maven archetypes for creating integration projects using the Red Hat supported Apache projects.
* Adding new pieces of logic and functionality to an application.
The tooling has a wizard for creating Apache Camel context files.
* Editing the integration logic.
The tooling has a visual route editor that makes editing Apache Camel routes as easy as dragging and dropping route components.
* Testing the application.
The tooling includes testing tools that provide the full gamut of testing capabilities including:
 creating JUnit test cases for Apache Camel routes
 JMX analysis of running components
 message tracing through Apache Camel routes
* Deploying the application.
The tooling can deploy applications to a number of containers.
