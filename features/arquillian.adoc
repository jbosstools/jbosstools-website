Arquilian Eclipse enables you to create Arquillian JUnit tests and generate a deployment method.

There is also the *Run As/Debug As>Arquillian JUnit Test* action that checks if the Arquillian test environment is valid.

== Arquillian validator 
=== Validate the Arquillian environment

The arquillian validator finds the following issues:

* classes that are used in a test, but aren't included in the deployment
* tests without a deployment method and/or a test method
* resources that can't be found 
* invalid archive name

The most of the issues have an Eclipse quick fix.
