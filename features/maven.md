summary: In the context of application development, Maven allows you to extend your applications by referencing and utilizing dependencies from local and remote repositories. JBoss Tools / JBoss Developer Studio also closes the gap between the maven world and the Eclipse/WebTools world with the help of the m2e-wtp integration, which finally lets you transparently use m2e on web projects.
