Teiid Designer allows you to create one or more layers of abstraction of your data via
the Transformation Editor. Utilize the built-in functions to manipulate, sort or convert your data from different
data sources into common re-usable views based on the data needs of your front-end applications.

is returned in the form you intended.  The preview data feature allows you to model a source table or view, the execute
a simple select query on it which returns a result set and a sample query execution plan.
