The BPEL editor supports editing Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), an XML based language that enables task sharing in a distributed

BPEL, export and import information by using web service interfaces only. 


JBoss BPEL is based on WS BPEL 2.0, and provides a way to create, edit, validate and deploy BPEL files to JBoss 
BPEL runtime. It is based on Eclipse BPEL project.
