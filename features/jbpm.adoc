== jBPM
=== Business Process Suite
image::images/features-jbpm-process.png[Business Process]

jBPM is a flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite.  A business process allows
you to model your business goals by describing the steps that need to be executed to 
achieve that goal and the order, using a flow chart.  This greatly improves the 
visibility and agility of your business logic, results in higher-level and 
domain-specific representations that can be understood by business users and is 
easier to monitor.

The aim of the new project wizard is to set up an executable sample project 
to start using processes immediately. This will set up a basic structure, the
classpath, sample process and a test case to get you started.  Supports selecting
a jBPM runtime for your project, or using Maven to get the jBPM core dependencies.
