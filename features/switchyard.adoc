== SwitchYard
=== Making SOA fun again

image::images/features-switchyard-editor-588px.png[SwitchYard Camel Editor with Project View]

SwitchYard is a component-based development framework focused on building
structured, maintainable services and applications using the concepts and best
practices of SOA. It works with Apache Camel to provide a fast, simple,
flexible integration runtime with comprehensive connectivity and transports. A
uniform application model augments Apache Camel, joining Java EE, BPM, rules,
orchestration, and routing into a cohesive development model and runtime.
Common functionality and cross-cutting concerns - validation, transformation and
policy - are isolated from business logic and handled declaratively. This
ensures consistency and eliminates duplication, offering developers a clear view
of the structure and relationships of services in an integration application.

== Project Wizard
=== Get started with SwitchYard

image::images/features-switchyard-new-project-wizard.jpg[]

Use the SwitchYard project wizard to create a Maven based project that can be
configured to use various components like CDI, jBPM, Drools, BPEL and Camel
routes, as well as a variety of endpoint types including: SOAP, REST, HTTP,
file, mail, JMS, JCA, S/FTP, JPA, SQL, TCP/UDP and more.

== Unit Testing
=== Easily create unit tests for services

Easily generate test stubs for all your services using the new service test
wizard, which is easily accessible on the tool pad for any service or reference
in the SwitchYard editor.

== Java <=> WSDL
=== Easily create WSDL files from Java interfaces or vice versa

SwitchYard tools allow you to easily integrate Java and WSDL based interfaces.
The handy wizards and built-in support for JAXB make the process easy as pie.
