== SwitchYard
=== Making SOA fun again

SwitchYard is a component-based development framework focused on building
structured, maintainable services and applications using the concepts and best
practices of SOA. It works with Apache Camel to provide a fast, simple,
flexible integration runtime with comprehensive connectivity and transports. A
uniform application model augments Apache Camel, joining Java EE, BPM, rules,
orchestration, and routing into a cohesive development model and runtime.
Common functionality and cross-cutting concerns - validation, transformation and
policy - are isolated from business logic and handled declaratively. This
ensures consistency and eliminates duplication, offering developers a clear view
of the structure and relationships of services in an integration application.

For full details, checkout the http://www.jboss.org/switchyard[SwitchYard project home page].

== Project Wizard
=== Get started with SwitchYard

image::images/features-switchyard-new-project-wizard.jpg[]

Use the SwitchYard project wizard to create a Maven based project that can be
configured to use various components like CDI, jBPM, Drools, BPEL and Camel
routes, as well as a variety of endpoint types including: SOAP, REST, HTTP,
file, mail, JMS, JCA, S/FTP, JPA, SQL, TCP/UDP and more.

== Configure SwitchYard Capabilities
=== Easily add and remove support for specific SwitchYard capabilities

It's easy to add SwitchYard support to existing Maven projects, as well as
updating the capabilities (e.g. CDI, BPM, SOAP, FTP, etc.) used on your project.
The SwitchYard project validator will let you know if your project is missing a
capability or if any specified capabilities are superfluous (based on features
used in your project).

== The SwitchYard Editor
=== Making it easy to create and configure your SwitchYard application

The SwitchYard editor makes it easy to manage the configuration of your
application, providing the following features:

* Creation and configuration of components, services and references.
* Component service/reference promotion and configuration of gateway bindings.
* Creation of implementation skeletons for new service components (e.g. bean classes, BPMN2 files, DRL files, etc.).
* Creation of unit test skeletons for services.
* Configuration of message transformers, including creation of implementation skeletons for message transformers (e.g. XSL, Java, etc.).
* Creation of Artifact references.

== Unit Testing
=== Easily create unit tests for services

Easily generate test stubs for all your services using the new service test
wizard, which is easily accessible on the tool pad for any service or reference
in the SwitchYard editor.
