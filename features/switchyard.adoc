==== _SwitchYard Applications - What are they?_

SwitchYard allows you to deploy and run services with limited dependencies. A SwitchYard application consists of the following components which provide service definitions and accessibility.

===== Component

A component is a modular container for application logic.  Services and references allow a component to interact with other components, while the implementation provides the actual logic for providing or consuming services

===== Composite

A composite represents the boundary between what is inside your application and what is outside your application. A SwitchYard application consists of exactly one composite that has a name and a targetNamespace. The targetNamespace allows names defined locally in the application to be qualified and unique within a SwitchYard runtime.

===== Implementation

An implementation acts as the brain of a service component and it is how you implement your application logic. 

===== Component Service

A component service is used to expose the functionality of an implementation as a service. All component services have a contract, which can be a Java interface, WSDL portType definition, or a set of named data types.

===== Composite Service

A composite service is a promoted component service that represents an application service which is visible to other applications.

===== Service Binding

A service binding is used to define an access method for a composite service.  In most cases, a service binding represents a protocol or transport adapter (for example, SOAP, JMS, and REST).

===== Component Reference

A component reference allows a component to consume other services. A component reference can be wired to a service offered by another component in the same application or it can be wired to services outside the application via a composite reference.

===== Composite Reference

A composite reference allows a component reference to be wired to a service outside the application.  Similar to composite services, bindings are used with composite references to specify the communication method for invoking the external service.

===== Reference Bindings

A reference binding is used to define an access method for an external service via a composite reference. Unlike service bindings, there can only be one binding for each composite reference. The set of bindings available for references is identical to the set of bindings available for services, although the configuration values for a given binding may be different depending on whether it's used as a service binding or a reference binding.

==== _What component service implementations does SwitchYard provide?_

===== Bean

The Bean Component is a pluggable container in SwitchYard which allows Java classes (or beans) to provide and consume services. T his means that you can implement a service by simply annotating a Java class. It also means you can consume a service by injecting a reference to that service directly into your Java class.

===== BPM

The BPM Component is a pluggable container in SwitchYard that allows you to expose a business process as a service. Using the BPM component, you can start a process, signal a process event, or abort a process.

===== BPEL

The BPEL Component is a pluggable container in SwitchYard that allows you to expose a WS-BPEL business process as a service through an interface defined using WSDL.

===== Camel

Camel services allow you to leverage the core routing engine of Apache Camel to route between services in SwitchYard. Camel endpoints function as protocol adapters, exposing services hosted in SwitchYard to the outside world and allowing external services to be invoked from within SwitchYard. 

===== Rules

The Rules component is a pluggable container in SwitchYard which allows you to expose business rules as a service. You can add a custom interface to your rules and annotate its methods to define which methods should execute the rules. The Rules component supports Drools as the rule engine.

===== Knowledge Services

Knowledge Services are SwitchYard services that leverage Knowledge, Innovation and Enterprise (KIE) and provide knowledge based content as outputs. The Knowledge Services leverage Drools and jBPM.  Drools and jBPM are tightly integrated under KIE, and hence both SwitchYard's BPM component and Rules component share most of their runtime configuration.

==== _What SCA bindings does SwitchYard support?_

The Service Component Architecture (SCA) binding provides a means by which SwitchYard services and SwitchYard-aware clients communicate with one another. It facilitates inter-application communication within a SwitchYard runtime and provides clustering of SwitchYard services in two or more SwitchYard instances.  The supported SCA bindings are:

SOAP, HTTP, RESTEasy, JCA, JMS, File, FTP/ FTPS/ SFTP, TCP/ UDP, JPA, SQL, Mail, Quartz, Timer, SEDA, Camel URI and SCA.
