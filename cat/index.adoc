Welcome to JBoss Tools Community Acceptance Testing (JBoss Tools CAT)!

JBoss Tools CAT is an effort to obtain feedback from the JBoss
Tools and JBoss Developer Studio users that the features in early
builds are working fine. This will help us asses the quality of the
final release.

The goal of the JBoss Tools CAT is to get as much feedback on our Alpha, Beta and pre-GA
builds as possible.  We are looking for feedback on usability,
stability, quality and performance for new features. Reports on any
regression for any existing features that are already used is very
important.

== Get started

== CAT Member responsibilities

What types of tests should you perform?

As a member of the JBoss Tools CAT team you are requested to give feedback
on any two functional areas you choose to focus on. It is fully
acceptable to only use the Beta and CR builds, but it is highly
recommended and appreciated if you use and test the nightly
development builds too.

So, select the features in JBoss Tools that you are most interested in, and start testing!

You can communicate to the JBoss Tools team and other CAT members via
irc://irc.freenode.org/jbosstools-cat[irc],
http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-cat/[mailing list] or
https://issues.jboss.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12316999[JIRA].

We may request additional input via surveys or online IRC meetings when JBoss Tools CAT
is active and at the end of a release we will send a survey where you can express your opinion
on whether the new features are ready for release and the features you depend on have not regressed.

== What Happens to Bugs and Feature Requests?

The JBoss Tools CAT team managers will review and respond to all new bugs and feature requests.

== I have other questions ?
