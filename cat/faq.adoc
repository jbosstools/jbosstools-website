What is JBoss Tools Cat?::
  JBoss Tools CAT is an effort to get better and receive early feedback that the
features in JBoss Tools are working well and getting confirmation from
JBoss Tools and Developer Studio community that the quality is ready
for the final release.

Didn't Netbeans have this first?::
   Yes, the Netbeans CAT program is what inspired us to do this. We hope it will
work equally well here too. Thanks for the inspiration.

What is the award for participating in the JBoss Tools CAT?::
   At the end of a testing/release, we will give the CAT testers that have been active a certificate for participation, a honorable mention on the release blog/website and for the top contributors we will give LinkedIn recommendations.
