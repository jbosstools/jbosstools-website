[qanda]
What is JBoss Tools Cat?::
  JBoss Tools CAT is an effort to get better and early feedback that the
features in JBoss Tools are working well and getting confirmation from
JBoss Tools and Developer Studio community that the quality is ready
for the final release.

Didn't Netbeans have this first?::
   Yes, the Netbeans CAT program is what inspired us to do this. We hope it will
work equally well here too.

Why does the visual part in the visual editor not work?::
  The Visual Page Editor uses the last XULRunner that have a Java API to do its visual rendering which unfortunately limits which operating systems it can run on and in some cases some pacakges needs to be installed on your OS for it to work. You can see link:https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBosstoolsVisualEditorFAQ[Visual Page Editor FAQ] for possible solutions/workaround.

Which operating systems, runtimes and frameworks does JBoss Tools support?::
  In general JBoss Tools attempts to ensure you can continue to use both old and new runtimes &amp; frameworks with its releases but we do not add new features to old streams. Support for the latest &amp; greatest runtimes will only be available in the latest releases. This link:https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MatrixOfSupportedPlatformsRuntimesAndTechnologiesInJBossToolsJBDS[Matrix] gives an overivew of the various supported frameworks, runtimes, operating systems, platforms, and JDK versions.
